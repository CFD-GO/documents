abstract = {In this paper a lattice Boltzmann (LB) model to simulate incompressible flow is developed. The main idea is to explicitly eliminate the terms of o(M2), where M is the Mach number, due to the density fluctuation in the existing LB models. In the proposed incompressible LB model, the pressure p instead of the mass density p is the independent dynamic variable. The incompressible Navier- Stokes equations are derived from the incompressible LB model via Chapman- Enskog procedure. Numerical results of simulations of the plane Poiseuille flow driven either by pressure gradient or a fixed velocity profile at entrance as well as of the 2D Womersley flow are presented. The numerical results are found to be in excellent agreement with theory.},

Today, we do so even more, and we do not regret it: key advances in the understanding and fabrication of surfaces with controlled wetting properties are about to make the dream of a contamination-free (or 'no-clean') surface come true. Two routes to self-cleaning are emerging, which work by the removal of dirt by either film or droplet flow. Although a detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying the behaviour of liquids on such surfaces is still a basic research topic, the first commercial products in the household-commodity sector and for applications in biotechnology are coming within reach of the marketplace. This progress report describes the current status of understanding of the underlying mechanisms, the concepts for making such surfaces, and some of their first applications.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a simple and accurate lattice Boltzmann (LB) model for immiscible two-phase flows, which is able to deal with large density contrasts. This model utilizes two LB equations, one of which is used to solve the conservative Allen-Cahn equation, and the other is adopted to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. A novel forcing distribution function is elaborately designed in the LB equation for the Navier-Stokes equations, which make it much simpler than the existing LB models. In addition, the proposed model can achieve superior numerical accuracy compared with previous Allen-Cahn type of LB models. Several benchmark two-phase problems, including static droplet, layered Poiseuille flow, and Spinodal decomposition are simulated to validate the present LB model. It is found that the present model can achieve relatively small spurious velocities in the LB community, and the obtained numerical results also show good agreement with the analytical solutions or some available results. At last, we use the present model to investigate the droplet impact on a thin liquid film with a large density ratio of 1000 and the Reynolds number ranging from 20 to 500. The fascinating phenomenon of droplet splashing is successfully reproduced by the present model and the numerically predicted spreading radius exhibits to obey the power law reported in the literature.},

@article{Krause2013,
abstract = {A lattice Boltzmann (LB) framework to solve fluid flow control and optimisation problems numerically is presented. Problems are formulated on a mesoscopic basis. In a side condition, the dynamics of a Newtonian fluid is described by a family of simplified Boltzmann-like equations, namely BGK-Boltzmann equations, which are linked to an incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. It is proposed to solve the non-linear optimisation problem by a line search algorithm. The needed derivatives are obtained by deriving the adjoint equations, referred to as adjoint BGK-Boltzmann equations. The primal equations are discretised by standard lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) while for the adjoint equations a novel discretisation strategy is introduced. The approach follows the main ideas behind LBM and is therefore referred to as adjoint lattice Boltzmann methods (ALBM). The corresponding algorithm retains most of the basic features of LB algorithms. In particular, it enables a highly-efficient parallel implementation and thus solving large-scale fluid flow control and optimisation problems. The overall solution strategy, the derivation of a prototype adjoint BGK-Boltzmann equation, the novel ALBM and its parallel realisation as well as its validation are discussed in detail in this article. Numerical and performance results are presented for a series of steady-state distributed control problems with up to approximately 1.6 million unknown control parameters obtained on a high performance computer with up to 256 processing units. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A recently developed forcing scheme has allowed the pseudopotential multiphase lattice Boltzmann method to correctly reproduce coexistence curves, while expanding its range to lower surface tensions and arbitrarily high density ratios [Lycett-Brown and Luo, Phys. Rev. E 91, 023305 (2015)]. Here, a third-order Chapman-Enskog analysis is used to extend this result from the single-relaxation-time collision operator, to a multiple-relaxation-time cascaded collision operator, whose additional relaxation rates allow a significant increase in stability. Numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme enables almost independent control of density ratio, surface tension, interface width, viscosity, and the additional relaxation rates of the cascaded collision operator. This allows simulation of large density ratio flows at simultaneously high Reynolds and Weber numbers, which is demonstrated through binary collisions of water droplets in air (with density ratio up to 1000, Reynolds number 6200 and Weber number 440). This model represents a significant improvement in multiphase flow simulation by the pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann method in which real-world parameters are finally achievable.},

It was previously assumed that the appropriate attractors for the relaxation of these moments were their equilibria values as derived from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. However, when the attractor for fourth-order central moments is derived that way, the solution of three-dimensional lattice Boltzmann differs significantly from the analytical solution of the Navier-Stokes equation for simple test cases like Poiseuille flow. We show that the Navier-Stokes solution is recovered when we chose products of low order central moments as the attractors of the higher order central moments.},

abstract = {The surface characteristics, such as wettability and roughness, play an important role in heat transfer performance in the field of microfluidic flow. In this paper, the process of a hot liquid flowing through a microchannel with cold walls, which possesses different surface wettabilities and microstructures, is simulated by a transient double-distribution function (DDF) two-phase thermal lattice Boltzmann BGK (LBGK) model. The Shan-Chen multiphase LBGK model is used to describe the flow field and the independent distribution function is introduced to solve the temperature field. The simulation results show that the roughness of the channel wall improves the heat transfer, no matter what the surface wettability is. These simulations reveal that the heat exchange characteristics are directly related to the flow behavior. For the smooth-superhydrophobic-surface flow, a gas film forms that acts as an insulating layer since the thermal conductivity of the gas is relatively small in comparison to that of a liquid. In case of the rough-superhydrophobic-surface flow, the vortex motion of the gas within the grooves significantly enhances the heat exchange between the fluid and wall.},

The considered cases include stationary and time-dependent flows past a circular or a 45-degree rotated square cylinder confined in the channel with parallel walls. Next, the same flow configurations are investigated by means of the Spectral Element Method (SEM) and obtained results are used to cross-validate both approaches. The sensitivity to the resolution of representation of the obstacle{\&}rsquo;s shape in the LBM simulations is of the main interest. Particular attention is paid also to the effects of compressibility of the flow. Additionally, for unsteady flows the transient flow characteristics are compared in detail: the velocity profiles from the LBM and SEM are presented and some non-dimensional characteristics such as Strouhal number of the compared von Karman vortex streets.},

abstract = {A lattice Boltzmann model (LBM) is proposed based on the phase-field theory to simulate incompressible binary fluids with density and viscosity contrasts. Unlike many existing diffuse interface models which are limited to density matched binary fluids, the proposed model is capable of dealing with binary fluids with moderate density ratios. A new strategy for projecting the phase field to the viscosity field is proposed on the basis of the continuity of viscosity flux. The new LBM utilizes two lattice Boltzmann equations (LBEs): one for the interface tracking and the other for solving the hydrodynamic properties. The LBE for interface tracking can recover the Chan-Hilliard equation without any additional terms; while the LBE for hydrodynamic properties can recover the exact form of the divergence-free incompressible Navier-Stokes equations avoiding spurious interfacial forces. A series of 2D and 3D benchmark tests have been conducted for validation, which include a rigid-body rotation, stationary and moving droplets, a spinodal decomposition, a buoyancy-driven bubbly flow, a layered Poiseuille flow, and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. It is shown that the proposed method can track the interface with high accuracy and stability and can significantly and systematically reduce the parasitic current across the interface. Comparisons with momentum-based models indicate that the newly proposed velocity-based model can better satisfy the incompressible condition in the flow fields, and eliminate or reduce the velocity fluctuations in the higher-pressure-gradient region and, therefore, achieve a better numerical stability. In addition, the test of a layered Poiseuille flow demonstrates that the proposed scheme for mixture viscosity performs significantly better than the traditional mixture viscosity methods.},

The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

We find a decrease of the detected slip with increasing shear rate which is in contrast to some recent experimental results implicating that bubble deformation cannot account for these experiments.

Both for droplets moving down an inclined surface and for an external flow near the surface (hydrofoil), there is evidence of appreciable drag reduction in the presence of surface texture combined with superhydrophobic coating. On textured inclined surfaces, the drops roll faster than on a coated untextured surface at the same angle. The highest drop velocities are achieved on surfaces with irregular textures with characteristic feature size ∼ 8 $\mu$m. Application of the same texture and coating to the surface of a hydrofoil in a water tunnel results in drag reduction on the order of 10{\%} or higher. This behavior is explained by the reduction of the contact area between the surface and the fluid, which can be interpreted in terms of changing the macroscopic boundary condition to allow nonzero slip velocity. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics},

abstract = {Over the past few decades, tremendous progress has been made in the development of particle-based discrete simulation methods versus the conventional continuum-based methods. In particular, the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method has evolved from a theoretical novelty to a ubiquitous, versatile and powerful computational methodology for both fundamental research and engineering applications. It is a kinetic-based mesoscopic approach that bridges the microscales and macroscales, which offers distinctive advantages in simulation fidelity and computational efficiency. Applications of the LB method have been found in a wide range of disciplines including physics, chemistry, materials, biomedicine and various branches of engineering. The present work provides a comprehensive review of the LB method for thermofluids and energy applications, focusing on multiphase flows, thermal flows and thermal multiphase flows with phase change. The review first covers the theoretical framework of the LB method, revealing the existing inconsistencies and defects as well as common features of multiphase and thermal LB models. Recent developments in improving the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic consistency, reducing the spurious currents, enhancing the numerical stability, etc., are highlighted. These efforts have put the LB method on a firmer theoretical foundation with enhanced LB models that can achieve larger liquid-gas density ratio, higher Reynolds number and flexible surface tension. Examples of applications are provided in fuel cells and batteries, droplet collision, boiling heat transfer and evaporation, and energy storage. Finally, further developments and future prospect of the LB method are outlined for thermofluids and energy applications.},

The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

abstract = {A Lattice-Boltzmann model for high-speed non-isothermal subsonic flows is used to simulate the unsteady jet exhausting from a short-cowl axisymmetric coaxial nozzle and the associated noise. The primary and secondary jet exit Mach numbers are 0.87 and 0.90, respectively, the secondary jet Reynolds number is 2.8 {\textperiodcentered}106, and the primary to secondary temperature ratio is 2.7. The far-field is computed through a Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings analogy applied to a fluid surface encompassing the plume. Numerical results are presented for one exhaust condition and for one grid resolution only; in this respect, the main achievements of the present effort are a sanity check of the simulation setup and a first stage of a grid resolution study. The presented near- and far-field results confirm that the underlying flow features are reasonably represented by the numerical solution. Areas of required improvements have been clearly identified in the growth rate of the shear-layer turbulent fluctuations and will be the main objective of future studies. More in general, the sensitivity of the jet turbulent properties to the mesh resolution will be investigated and published in the future as a completing part of the present work. 1.},

By the simulation, it can be seen that the depth-to-width ratio of the cavities between adjacent micro-ridges is an important effect parameter for the flow in the micro-channel. For the larger depth-to-width ratio, it is easy to keep the air in the cavities. Because of the influence of the air, there is no vortex phenomenon downstream of each micro-ridge. Such vortices are a common phenomenon in macro flows. The simulated results coincide with those of experiments. Moreover, keeping the air in the cavities, one can also find that the smaller the solid area fraction, the greater the slipping velocity at the air-water interface. With a decrease of the solid area fractions, the average exit velocity increases and the flow drag coefficient decreases.},

Several EOS are explored: van der Waals, Carnahan-Starling and Kaplun-Meshalkin EOS [A.B. Kaplun, A.B. Meshalkin, Thermodynamic validation of the form of unified equation of state for liquid and gas, High Temperature 41 (3) (2003) 319-326]. The last one was modified in order to obtain the correct critical point. The Carnahan-Starling and modified Kaplun-Meshalkin EOS are in better agreement with the experimental data on coexistence curves than the van der Waals EOS. It is shown that the approximation of the gradient of special potential is crucial to obtain the correct coexistence curve, especially its low-density part. The correct method of incorporating the body forces into the lattice Boltzmann model is also very important. We propose a new scheme which allows us to obtain large density ratio (up to 109in the stationary case) and to reproduce the coexistence curve with high accuracy. The spurious currents at vapor-liquid interface are also greatly reduced. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This method combines the good features of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and the immersed boundary method (IBM) by using two unrelated computational meshes, an Eulerian mesh for the flow domain and a Lagrangian mesh for the solid boundaries in the flow. In this method, the non-slip boundary condition is enforced by introducing a forcing term into the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE). Unlike the conventional IBM using the penalty method with a user-defined parameter or the direct forcing scheme based on the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, the forcing term is simply calculated by the momentum exchange of the boundary particle density distribution functions, which are interpolated by the Lagrangian polynomials from the underlying Eulerian mesh. Numerical examples show that the present method can provide very accurate numerical results. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The so-called lattice Boltzmann models describe the fluid. These models are defined for the document to be self-contained. This description is a good starting point for beginners but can also serves as a reference document for advanced read- ers. Boundary and flow settlement conditions are reviewed and a new boundary condition, which is mass conserving, is proposed and compared to existing ones conditions. To reach high Reynolds number, we use the so-called Smagorinsky model of turbulence which is clearly presented in the present lattice Boltzmann context. Mesh refinement techniques are reviewed and a more general algorithm is proposed. We define rules describing the behavior of the sediments. Then, we focus our attention on two applications: scour formation under submarine pipelines and meanders in rivers. Results of the first application are in agreement with the literature. We give an explanation at the mesoscopic level of the meandering process. Our preliminary results confirm our theory. To produce reusable and efficient implementations of our virtual rivers, we propose a parallel object-oriented environment for lattice based simulations called PELABS. Its performances are measured and analyzed. Due to its object-oriented architecture, we exhibit that, at worst, it is two times slower than a procedural implementation. Moreover, under certain conditions, it can be faster.},

E $\backslash$textbf{\{}63{\}}, 066705 (2006)] has been proved to possess very good numerical stability, and applied to a series of complex flows. However, two constraints still exist in three-dimensional (3D) CLBM simulations. Firstly, the practical implementation for 3D CLBM involves cumbersome notations and needs much higher computational cost compared to the classical single-relaxation-time (SRT) LBM. Secondly, it is still puzzling about how to accurately incorporate a general force field into the 3D CLBM. In this paper, we present a simplified method to implement CLBM in 3D. The main strategy is to adopt a simplified central moment set, and carry out the central-moment-based collision operator based on a general multi-relaxation-time (GMRT) framework. Next, the recently proposed consistent forcing scheme in CLBM [L. Fei and K. H. Luo, Phys. Rev. E $\backslash$textbf{\{}96{\}}, 053307 (2017)] is extended to incorporate a general force field into 3D CLBM. Compared with the most recently developed non-orthogonal CLBM [A. D. Rosis, Phys. Rev. E $\backslash$textbf{\{}95{\}}, 013310 (2017)], our proposed simplified implementation is proved to reduce the computational cost significantly. The inconsistency of adopting the discrete equilibrium distribution functions (EDFs) in the non-orthogonal CLBM is also discussed and revealed. The consistent forcing scheme in 3D CLBM is verified through numerical simulations of several canonical force-driven flows, highlighting very good properties in terms of accuracy, convergence and consistency of the nonslip rule. In addition, the proposed simplified methodology in CLBM indicates directions to simplify the MRT-LBM.},

abstract = {The mechanism of drag reduction by using superhydrophobic surfaces whose contact angle is greater than 150° is still an open problem that needs to be investigated. The main purpose of this paper is to reveal how the pressure drop can be decreased. The lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) is employed to investigate fluid flows through channels with different wettability conditions and topographical surfaces. The drag reduction by superhydrophobic surfaces is determined based on numerical experiments. For the smooth-surface flow, a very thin gas film is observed between the fluid and the superhydrophobic wall; hence, the liquid/solid interface is replaced by the gas/liquid interface. For the rough-surface flow, liquid sweeps over the grooves and the contact area is reduced; therefore, the friction is decreased rapidly. Additionally, the effects of surface wettability and surface roughness are analyzed as well. It is found that introducing roughness elements has a positive effect for reducing the pressure drop for the hydrophobic-surface flow, but has a negative effect for the hydrophilic-surface flow. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The flow of viscous incompressible fluid over a periodically corrugated surface is investigated numerically by solving the Navier–Stokes equation with the local slip and no-slip boundary conditions. We consider the effective slip length which is defined with respect to the level of the mean height of the surface roughness. With increasing corrugation amplitude the effective no-slip boundary plane is shifted toward the bulk of the fluid, which implies a negative effective slip length. The analysis of the wall shear stress indicates that a flow circulation is developed in the grooves of the rough surface provided that the local boundary condition is no-slip. By applying a local slip boundary condition, the center of the vortex is displaced toward the bottom of the grooves and the effective slip length increases. When the intrinsic slip length is larger than the corrugation amplitude, the flow streamlines near the surface are deformed to follow the boundary curvature, the vortex vanishes, and the effective slip length saturates to a constant value. Inertial effects promote vortexflow formation in the grooves and reduce the effective slip length.},

abstract = {We propose a thermal boundary condition treatment based on the " bounce-back" idea and interpolation of the distribution functions for both the Dirichlet and Neumann (normal derivative) conditions in the thermal lattice Boltzmann equation (TLBE) method. The coefficients for the distribution functions involved are determined to satisfy the Dirichlet or Neumann condition with second-order accuracy. For the Dirichlet condition there is an adjustable parameter in the treatment and three particular schemes are selected for demonstration, while for the Neumann condition the second-order accurate scheme is unique. When applied to inclined or curved boundaries, the Dirichlet condition treatment can be directly used, while the Neumann condition given in the normal direction of the boundary should be converted into derivative conditions in the discrete velocity directions of the TLBE model. A spatially coupled formula relating the boundary temperature, boundary normal heat flux, and the distribution functions near the boundary is thus derived for the Neumann problems on curved boundaries. The applicability and accuracy of the present boundary treatments are examined with several numerical tests for which analytical solutions are available, including the 2-dimensional (2-D) steady-state channel flow, the 1-D transient heat conduction in an inclined semi-infinite solid, the 2-D steady-state and transient heat conduction inside a circle and the 3-D steady-state circular pipe flow. While the Dirichlet condition treatment leads to second-order accuracy for the temperature field, it only gives a first-order accurate boundary heat flux because of the irregularity of the cuts by the curved boundary with the lattices. With the Neumann condition on the curved boundary, the accuracy for the temperature field obtained is first-order. When the tangential temperature gradient on the boundary is decoupled, second-order convergence of the temperature field can be obtained with Neumann conditions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The influence of surface roughness on the slip behaviour of a Newtonian liquid in steady planar shear is investigated using three different approaches, namely Stokes flow calculations, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a statistical mechanical model for the friction coefficient between a corrugated wall and the first liquid layer. These approaches are used to probe the behaviour of the slip length as a function of the slope parameter ka = 2 pi a/lambda, where a and lambda represent the amplitude and wavelength characterizing the periodic corrugation of the bounding surface. The molecular and continuum approaches both confirm a monotonic decay in the slip length with increasing ka but the rate of decay as well as the magnitude of the slip length obtained from the Stokes flow solutions exceed the MD predictions as the wall feature sizes approach the liquid molecular dimensions. In the limit of molecular-scale wall corrugation, a Green-Kubo analysis based on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem accurately reproduces the MD results for the behaviour of the slip length as a function of a. In combination, these three approaches provide a detailed picture of the influence of periodic roughness on the slip length which spans multiple length scales ranging from molecular to macroscopic dimensions.},

abstract = {The generalized hydrodynamics (the wave vector dependence of the transport coefficients) of a generalized lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) is studied in detail. The generalized lattice Boltzmann equation is constructed in moment space rather than in discrete velocity space. The generalized hydrodynamics of the model is obtained by solving the dispersion equation of the linearized LBE either analytically by using perturbation technique or numerically. The proposed LBE model has a maximum number of adjustable parameters for the given set of discrete velocities. Generalized hydrodynamics characterizes dispersion, dissipation (hyperviscosities), anisotropy, and lack of Galilean invariance of the model, and can be applied to select the values of the adjustable parameters that optimize the properties of the model. The proposed generalized hydrodynamic analysis also provides some insights into stability and proper initial conditions for LBE simulations. The stability properties of some two-dimensional LBE models are analyzed and compared with each other in the parameter space of the mean streaming velocity and the viscous relaxation time. The procedure described in this work can be applied to analyze other LBE models. As examples, LBE models with various interpolation schemes are analyzed. Numerical results on shear flow with an initially discontinuous velocity profile (shock) with or without a constant streaming velocity are shown to demonstrate the dispersion effects in the LBE model; the results compare favorably with our theoretical analysis. We also show that whereas linear analysis of the LBE evolution operator is equivalent to Chapman-Enskog analysis in the long-wavelength limit (wave vector k=0), it can also provide results for large values of k. Such results are important for the stability and other hydrodynamic properties of the LBE method and cannot be obtained through Chapman-Enskog analysis.},

The far-field is computed through a Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings analogy applied to a fluid surface encompassing the plume. Numerical results are presented for one exhaust condition and for one grid resolution only; in this respect, the main achievements of the present effort are a sanity check of the simulation setup and a first stage of a grid resolution study. The presented near- and far-field results confirm that the underlying flow features are reasonably represented by the numerical solution. Areas of required improvements have been clearly identified in the growth rate of the shear-layer turbulent fluctuations and will be the main objective of future studies.

In this model, the sharp interfaces between different phases are separated by a narrow transition layers, and the kinetics and morphology evolution of phase separation would be characterized by an order parameter via Cahn-Hilliard equation which is solved in the frame work of LBE. The scalar convection-diffusion equation for temperature field is resolved by thermal LBE. The models are validated by thermal two layered Poiseuille flow, and two superimposed planar fluids at negligibly small Reynolds and Marangoni numbers for the thermocapillary driven convection, which have analytical solutions for the velocity and temperature. Then thermocapillary migration of two/three dimensional deformable droplet are simulated. Numerical results show that the predictions of present LBE agreed with the analytical solution/other numerical results.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.In this paper, the Shan-Chen-type multiphase lattice Boltzmann model was proposed to investigate two-phase flows around a hydrofoil. In the model, The Shan-Chen force accounts for the attraction force calculated over nearest neighbours of the pseudopotential function, which is employed to mimic the molecular interactions that cause phase segregation. Firstly, the lattice Boltzmann model was validated by the liquid flows around a hydrofoil by means of comparison of drag coefficients and the Shan-Chen model was validated by the Laplace law. And then aiming at various existing bubbles of different radii preplaced above the hydrofoil leading edge, the evolution of gasliquid two-phase flows was successfully reproduced based on heterogeneous cavitation assumption. The shedding bubbles become smaller and smaller downstream the hydrofoil, and finally collapse behind the tailing edge. The inter-particle forces are analyzed based on the two-phase flow density, and then the corresponding pseudo-velocity distribution is predicted near the phase interface. Then the attached cavitating flows is studied based on homogeneous cavitation assumption. It can be concluded that the attached cavitation occurs and evolves under some reasonable conditions. It can be found that that a small change in the velocity or pressure will bring great influence on the bubble size. All the above-analyses demonstrate that Shan-Chen multiphase model can capture well the inter-phase force and can be treated as an alternative potential approach for predicting cavitating flows.},

abstract = {Superhydrophobic surfaces have been demonstrated to be capable of reducing fluid resistance in micro- and nanofluidic applications. The objective of this paper is to present analytical solutions for the Stokes flow through microchannels employing superhydrophobic surfaces with alternating micro-grooves and ribs. Results are presented for both cases where the micro-grooves are aligned parallel and perpendicular to the flow direction. The effects of patterning the grooves on one or both channel walls are also analyzed. The reduction in fluid resistance has been quantified in terms of a dimensionless effective slip length, which is found to increase monotonically with the shear-free fraction and the periodic extent of each groove-rib combination normalized by the channel half-height. Asymptotic relationships have been derived for the normalized effective slip length corresponding to large and small limiting values of the shear-free fraction and the normalized groove-rib period. A detailed comparison has been made between transverse and longitudinal grooves, patterned on one or both channel walls, to assess their effectiveness in terms of enhancing the effective slip length. These comparisons have been carried out for small and large limiting values, as well as finite values of the shear-free fraction and normalized groove-rib period. Results for the normalized effective slip length corresponding to transverse and longitudinal grooves are further applied to model the Stokes flow through microchannels employing superhydrophobic surfaces containing a periodic array of micro-grooves inclined at an angle to the direction of the applied pressure gradient. Results are presented for the normalized effective slip lengths parallel to the direction of the applied pressure gradient and the normalized cross flow rate perpendicular to the direction of the applied pressure gradient.},

abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann space/time discretisation, as usually derived from integration along characteristics, is shown to correspond to a Strang splitting between decoupled streaming and collision steps. Strang splitting offers a second-order accurate approximation to evolution under the combination of two non-commuting operators, here identified with the streaming and collision terms in the discrete Boltzmann partial differential equation. Strang splitting achieves second-order accuracy through a symmetric decomposition in which one operator is applied twice for half timesteps, and the other operator is applied once for a full timestep. We show that a natural definition of a half timestep of collisions leads to the same change of variables that was previously introduced using different reasoning to obtain a second-order accurate and explicit scheme from an integration of the discrete Boltzmann equation along characteristics. This approach extends easily to include general matrix collision operators, and also body forces. Finally, we show that the validity of the lattice Boltzmann discretisation for grid-scale Reynolds numbers larger than unity depends crucially on the use of a Crank-Nicolson approximation to discretise the collision operator. Replacing this approximation with the readily available exact solution for collisions uncoupled from streaming leads to a scheme that becomes much too diffusive, due to the splitting error, unless the grid-scale Reynolds number remains well below unity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

With the property of low drag and self-cleaning (antifouling), shark skin inspired riblet surfaces can also be used on navigation objects. In this paper, different marine drag reduction technologies are discussed, and a review of riblet performance studies is also given. Experimental parameters include riblet geometry, continuous and segmented configurations, fluid velocity (laminar and turbulent flow), fluid viscosity (water, oil and gas), and wettability are analyzed. However, force is obtained by area-weighted integral of shear stress distributions. So area of riblet surfaces is a crucial factor which has not been considered in many previous studies. An experiment is given to discuss the impact of area. This paper aims not only to contribute to a better understanding of marine drag reduction, but also to offer new perspectives to improve the current evaluation criteria of riblet drag reduction.},

It is a kinetic-based mesoscopic approach that bridges the microscales and macroscales, which offers distinctive advantages in simulation fidelity and computational efficiency. Applications of the LB method are now found in a wide range of disciplines including physics, chemistry, materials, biomedicine and various branches of engineering. The present work provides a comprehensive review of the LB method for thermofluids and energy applications, focusing on multiphase flows, thermal flows and thermal multiphase flows with phase change. The review first covers the theoretical framework of the LB method, revealing certain inconsistencies and defects as well as common features of multiphase and thermal LB models. Recent developments in improving the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic consistency, reducing spurious currents, enhancing the numerical stability, etc., are highlighted. These efforts have put the LB method on a firmer theoretical foundation with enhanced LB models that can achieve larger liquid-gas density ratio, higher Reynolds number and flexible surface tension. Examples of applications are provided in fuel cells and batteries, droplet collision, boiling heat transfer and evaporation, and energy storage. Finally, further developments and future prospect of the LB method are outlined for thermofluids and energy applications.},

abstract = {Superhydrophobic surfaces have attracted much attention lately as they present the possibility of achieving a substantial skin-friction drag reduction in turbulent flows. In this paper, the effects of a superhydrophobic surface, consisting of microgrates aligned in the flow direction, on skin-friction drag in turbulent flows were investigated through direct numerical simulation of turbulent channel flows. The superhydrophobic surface was modeled through a shear-free boundary condition on the air-water interface. Dependence of the effective slip length and resulting skin-friction drag on Reynolds number and surface geometry was examined. In laminar flows, the effective slip length depended on surface geometry only, independent of Reynolds number, consistent with an existing analysis. In turbulent flows, the effective slip length was a function of Reynolds number, indicating its dependence on flow conditions near the surface. The resulting drag reduction was much larger in turbulent flows than in laminar flows, and near-wall turbulence structures were significantly modified, suggesting that indirect effects resulting from modified turbulence structures played a more significant role in reducing drag in turbulent flows than the direct effect of the slip, which led to a modest drag reduction in laminar flows. It was found that the drag reduction in turbulent flows was well correlated with the effective slip length normalized by viscous wall units.},

It is open-source and released under the same GNU General Public License (GPL) as OpenFOAM. The source code is released as a publicly open software repository that includes detailed documentation and tutorial cases. Since mdFoam. + is designed entirely within the OpenFOAM C. ++ object-oriented framework, it inherits a number of key features. The code is designed for extensibility and flexibility, so it is aimed first and foremost as an MD research tool, in which new models and test cases can be developed and tested rapidly. Implementing mdFoam. + in OpenFOAM also enables easier development of hybrid methods that couple MD with continuum-based solvers. Setting up MD cases follows the standard OpenFOAM format, as mdFoam. + also relies upon the OpenFOAM dictionary-based directory structure. This ensures that useful pre- and post-processing capabilities provided by OpenFOAM remain available even though the fully Lagrangian nature of an MD simulation is not typical of most OpenFOAM applications. Results show that mdFoam. + compares well to another well-known MD code (e.g. LAMMPS) in terms of benchmark problems, although it also has additional functionality that does not exist in other open-source MD codes.

The latter model, presented under the name of "regularized lattice Boltzmann", is shown to substantially increase the stability and accuracy of LB models in numerical simulaiton. The model is furthermore found to be innovative due to the fact that it possesses an accurate dimensionless formulation in terms of macroscopic variables.

In the present work, a formulation of the intermolecular forces for binary fluids and the role of incompressibility on parasitic currents are examined.

abstract = {Modeling and simulation are very powerful tools and have become an integral part in the design and development of engineering systems. In the microscale domain, modeling and simulation have been applied in the development of microfluidic devices. Microdevices developed for sample mixing, sample dispersion, drug discovery, biochemical analysis and micropower systems have become possible only due to the impetus and insight gained from the simulation studies of fundamental microfluidic problems. Microfluidic device modeling comprises of dealing with interplay of multiphysics phenomena such as fluid flow, structure, surface and interfaces, etc. As the surface area to volume ratio increases with the decrease of the system feature size of microdevices, some physical phenomena which are insignificant in the macro domain become prominent in the micro domain. Some of the tried and tested macroscale theory and experimental results no longer show similar trends in the microscale. Hence dealing with simultaneously widely differing physics becomes too complicated in the microscale which include microfluidics, microtransport, microthermal, micromechanics, microlectronics and optics with biochemical thermodynamics and reaction kinetics. In this article, the use of numerical modeling and simulation techniques for flow in microchannels applied to microfluidic devices are presented encompassing all the relevant physics at the microscale by the state of the art multiphysics simulation tools such as CFD-ACE+, COMSOL, Fluent to name a few. Numerical simulation of electroosmotic effect on pressure-driven flows in the serpentine channel of a microfuel cell with variable zeta potential on the side walls is investigated and reported. The Poisson-Boltzmann and Navier-Stokes equations are solved numerically to investigate the electroosmotic driven flow phenomena. It is observed that vortices are developed at the straight portion of the microchannel due to the electroosmosis. Flow control in the serpentine microchannel by regulating the zeta potential at the bend has also been demonstrated. Capillary driven flow in a microchannel with alternate hydrophilic-hydrophobic patterns on the bottom wall is investigated for bioreactor applications. The transient flow is modeled by coupling the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with the interface evolution equation using volume of fluid (VOF) methodology. Higher order surface reconstruction method is adopted for interface tracking. Flow instability increases as the fluid traverses alternately between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. Such flow phenomena in the microchannel indicate that flow control is possible by patterning the channel walls for applications related to 1 Corresponding Author; Email: skmitra@iitb.ac.in},

The first part of the review begins with a description of the LBM and the original pseudopotential model. The distinct features and the limitations of the original model are described in detail. Then various enhancements necessary to improve the pseudopotential model in terms of decreasing the spurious currents, obtaining high density/viscosity ratio, reducing thermodynamic inconsistency, unraveling the coupling between surface tension and equations of state (EOS), and unraveling the coupling between viscosity and surface tension, are reviewed. Then the fluid-solid interactions are presented and schemes to obtain different contact angles are discussed. The final section of this part focuses on the multi-component multiphase pseudopotential model. The second part of this review describes fruitful applications of this model to various multiphase flows.

abstract = {Experimental and theoretical study of wetting properties of patterned Si surfaces with cylindrical flat-top pillars of various sizes and pitch distances is presented. The values of the contact angle (CA), contact angle hysteresis (CAH) and tilt angle (TA) are measured and compared with the theoretical values. Transition from the composite solid-liquid-air to the homogeneous solid-liquid interface is investigated. It is found that the wetting behaviour of a patterned hydrophobic surface depends upon a simple non-dimensional parameter, the spacing factor, equal to the pillar diameter divided by the pitch. The spacing factor controls the CA, CAH and TA in the composite interface regime, as well as destabilization and transition to the homogeneous interface. We show that the assumption that the CAH is a consequence of the adhesion hysteresis and surface roughness leads to the theoretical values of the CAH that are in a reasonably good agreement with the experimental values. By decreasing the spacing factor, the values of CA=170 degrees, CAH=5 degrees and TA=3 degrees are achieved. However, with further decreasing of the spacing factor, the composite interface destabilizes.},

abstract = {A lattice Boltzmann (LB) framework to solve fluid flow control and optimisation problems numerically is presented. Problems are formulated on a mesoscopic basis. In a side condition, the dynamics of a Newtonian fluid is described by a family of simplified Boltzmann-like equations, namely BGK-Boltzmann equations, which are linked to an incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. It is proposed to solve the non-linear optimisation problem by a line search algorithm. The needed derivatives are obtained by deriving the adjoint equations, referred to as adjoint BGK-Boltzmann equations. The primal equations are discretised by standard lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) while for the adjoint equations a novel discretisation strategy is introduced. The approach follows the main ideas behind LBM and is therefore referred to as adjoint lattice Boltzmann methods (ALBM). The corresponding algorithm retains most of the basic features of LB algorithms. In particular, it enables a highly-efficient parallel implementation and thus solving large-scale fluid flow control and optimisation problems. The overall solution strategy, the derivation of a prototype adjoint BGK-Boltzmann equation, the novel ALBM and its parallel realisation as well as its validation are discussed in detail in this article.

The classical models don not predict this kind of specified size phenomenon. Here we review some recent findings, which show that scaling down the surface roughness into the micro-submicron range is a unique and elegant strategy to not only achieve superhydrophobicity, but also increase its stability against environmental disturbances.

abstract = {In this paper, we give a more pellucid derivation for the cascaded lattice Boltzmann method (CLBM) based on a general multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) frame through defining a shift matrix. When the shift matrix is a unit matrix, the CLBM degrades into an MRT LBM. Based on this, a consistent forcing scheme is developed for the CLBM. The applicability of the non-slip rule, the second-order convergence rate in space and the property of isotropy for the consistent forcing scheme is demonstrated through the simulation of several canonical problems. Several other existing force schemes previously used in the CLBM are also examined. The study clarifies the relation between MRT LBM and CLBM under a general framework.},

abstract = {The accurate modelling of contact angle properties plays an important role in the simulation of free-surface micro flows. Taking capillary filling as an example, we first discuss the analytical solutions of a corresponding 1D description in certain limits and then derive an approximate analytical expression for the general case with constant contact angle. In case of a dynamic contact angle and contact line friction, the model is beyond an analytical treatment. We show that computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results exhibit a pronounced mesh dependence which is partly inherent to the modelling approach since the (non-integrable) viscous stress divergence at the three-phase contact line is commonly neglected in standard CFD simulations (see e.g. Hessel V, Hardt S, L{\"{o}}we H. Chemical micro process engineering: fundamentals, modelling and reactions. Weinheim: Wiley-VCH; 2004). Moreover, the numerical description of contact angles suffers from artificial diffusion for the type of volume-of-fluid method used. Introduction of a macroscopic slip range in combination with a localised body force close to the contact line turns out to remedy both problems. Considering capillary filling as an example, we show that accurate, mesh independent solutions of fluid dynamic problems involving contact angle dynamics are obtained already on coarse meshes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate that the superhydrophobic microchannel containing rectangular cavities displays significant drag reduction effect.

Augments in the pressure drop reduction tend to be large with the increase of the cavity fraction or the decrease of the channel height. The results also reveal that the variation of the normalized slip length with the cavity fraction tends to be more dramatic when the channel height is smaller.

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2016, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.In this paper, the Shan-Chen-type multiphase lattice Boltzmann model was proposed to investigate two-phase flows around a hydrofoil. In the model, The Shan-Chen force accounts for the attraction force calculated over nearest neighbours of the pseudopotential function, which is employed to mimic the molecular interactions that cause phase segregation. Firstly, the lattice Boltzmann model was validated by the liquid flows around a hydrofoil by means of comparison of drag coefficients and the Shan-Chen model was validated by the Laplace law. And then aiming at various existing bubbles of different radii preplaced above the hydrofoil leading edge, the evolution of gasliquid two-phase flows was successfully reproduced based on heterogeneous cavitation assumption. The shedding bubbles become smaller and smaller downstream the hydrofoil, and finally collapse behind the tailing edge. The inter-particle forces are analyzed based on the two-phase flow density, and then the corresponding pseudo-velocity distribution is predicted near the phase interface. Then the attached cavitating flows is studied based on homogeneous cavitation assumption. It can be concluded that the attached cavitation occurs and evolves under some reasonable conditions. It can be found that that a small change in the velocity or pressure will bring great influence on the bubble size. All the above-analyses demonstrate that Shan-Chen multiphase model can capture well the inter-phase force and can be treated as an alternative potential approach for predicting cavitating flows.},

An AD-based consistent discrete adjoint solver is developed which directly inherits the convergence properties of the primal flow solver due to the differentiation of the entire nonlinear fixed-point iterator. In ad- dition, a coupled CFD-CAA far-field noise prediction framework using a permeable surface Ffowcs Williams- Hawkings approach is also developed. The resultant AD-based discrete adjoint solver is applied to both drag and noise minimization problems.

However, the types of SHPo surfaces that would produce any meaningful amount of reduction get wet under liquid pressure or at surface defects, both of which are unavoidable in the real world. In this Letter, we solve the above problem by (1) discovering surface structures that allow the restoration of a gas blanket from a wetted state while fully immersed underwater and (2) devising a self-controlled gas-generation mechanism that maintains the SHPo condition under high liquid pressures (tested up to 7 atm) as well as in the presence of surface defects, thus removing a fundamental barrier against the implementation of SHPo surfaces for drag reduction.},

Here, a third-order Chapman-Enskog analysis is used to extend this result from the single-relaxation-time collision operator, to a multiple-relaxation-time cascaded collision operator, whose additional relaxation rates allow a significant increase in stability. Numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme enables almost independent control of density ratio, surface tension, interface width, viscosity, and the additional relaxation rates of the cascaded collision operator. This allows simulation of large density ratio flows at simultaneously high Reynolds and Weber numbers, which is demonstrated through binary collisions of water droplets in air (with density ratio up to 1000, Reynolds number 6200 and Weber number 440). This model represents a significant improvement in multiphase flow simulation by the pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann method in which real-world parameters are finally achievable.},

The drag reduction is measured by comparing the displacement of a SHPo surface with that of a smooth hydrophobic surface in a given flow. Since the two surfaces each with an identical set of suspending beams share the same processing conditions during the monolithic microfabrication and the same flow conditions during the TBL flow experiment, the rate of reduction is measured accurately with no bias errors. Furthermore, the air pockets on the SHPo surface are visually confirmed throughout the flow experiments to prevent any rogue surface condition affecting the measurement. The turbulent drag reduction is found to increase with the gas fraction of the SHPo surface, reaching a reduction of skin friction by as high as 70{\%}.},

abstract = {We propose a thermal boundary condition treatment based on the " bounce-back" idea and interpolation of the distribution functions for both the Dirichlet and Neumann (normal derivative) conditions in the thermal lattice Boltzmann equation (TLBE) method. The coefficients for the distribution functions involved are determined to satisfy the Dirichlet or Neumann condition with second-order accuracy. For the Dirichlet condition there is an adjustable parameter in the treatment and three particular schemes are selected for demonstration, while for the Neumann condition the second-order accurate scheme is unique. When applied to inclined or curved boundaries, the Dirichlet condition treatment can be directly used, while the Neumann condition given in the normal direction of the boundary should be converted into derivative conditions in the discrete velocity directions of the TLBE model. A spatially coupled formula relating the boundary temperature, boundary normal heat flux, and the distribution functions near the boundary is thus derived for the Neumann problems on curved boundaries. The applicability and accuracy of the present boundary treatments are examined with several numerical tests for which analytical solutions are available, including the 2-dimensional (2-D) steady-state channel flow, the 1-D transient heat conduction in an inclined semi-infinite solid, the 2-D steady-state and transient heat conduction inside a circle and the 3-D steady-state circular pipe flow. While the Dirichlet condition treatment leads to second-order accuracy for the temperature field, it only gives a first-order accurate boundary heat flux because of the irregularity of the cuts by the curved boundary with the lattices. With the Neumann condition on the curved boundary, the accuracy for the temperature field obtained is first-order. When the tangential temperature gradient on the boundary is decoupled, second-order convergence of the temperature field can be obtained with Neumann conditions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Strang splitting achieves second-order accuracy through a symmetric decomposition in which one operator is applied twice for half timesteps, and the other operator is applied once for a full timestep. We show that a natural definition of a half timestep of collisions leads to the same change of variables that was previously introduced using different reasoning to obtain a second-order accurate and explicit scheme from an integration of the discrete Boltzmann equation along characteristics. This approach extends easily to include general matrix collision operators, and also body forces. Finally, we show that the validity of the lattice Boltzmann discretisation for grid-scale Reynolds numbers larger than unity depends crucially on the use of a Crank-Nicolson approximation to discretise the collision operator. Replacing this approximation with the readily available exact solution for collisions uncoupled from streaming leads to a scheme that becomes much too diffusive, due to the splitting error, unless the grid-scale Reynolds number remains well below unity. {\textcopyright}2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t In this paper we present a topology optimization technique applicable to a broad range of flow design problems. We propose also a discrete adjoint formulation effective for a wide class of Lattice Boltzmann Methods (LBM). This adjoint formulation is used to calculate sensitivity of the LBM solution to several type of parameters, both global and local. The numerical scheme for solving the adjoint problem has many properties of the original sys-tem, including locality and explicit time-stepping. Thus it is possible to integrate it with the standard LBM solver, allowing for straightforward and efficient parallelization (overcom-ing limitations typical for the discrete adjoint solvers). This approach is successfully used for the channel flow to design a free-topology mixer and a heat exchanger. Both resulting geometries being very complex maximize their objective functions, while keeping viscous losses at acceptable level.},

abstract = {Real-time computer graphics and simulation has advanced to a level of realism that was regarded as unthinkable a few decades ago. However, uid simulations are still in an infant state for applications that require interactivity. Recent developments in programmability of graphics processing units on current graphics cards have enabled researchers to treat these cards as stream co-processors. This class of processors are designed for parallelizable algorithms that do not make heavy use of branching. Algorithms having these properties can be accelerated signicantly compared to implementations on current central processing units. Since grid-based uid simulations t perfectly into this scheme, this has become a hot topic in research. Various approaches will be presented in order to determine a combination of algorithms that can easily be parallelized and allow integrating rigid objects with complex boundaries into a uid simulation at interactive rates. Additionally, the usage of uid simulations in computer games will be discussed. An underwater pinball game will be introduced as a practical example, highlighting the considerations that have to be taken into account when adding this game element that was previously impossible to use.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development and the implementation of a 3D dynamic contact angle model into the VOF method provided by the commercial CFD code FLUENT for simulations of two phase flows with wetted boundaries. At present, FLUENT only allows user specified fixed values for the contact angle. This is physically quite limiting and leads to non-realistic interfacial effects for these applications. The contact angle becomes important in problems where the surface tension forces are more significant than the inertial forces. Problems are also encountered where dry patches are formed on channel walls, which give rise to a triple point between the wall, the liquid and the gas. This is often the case for two phase flows inside micro and mini channels. In FLUENT, the contact angle, which the fluid is assumed to make with the wall, is used to adjust the surface normal vector to the interface in cells near the wall. This so-called dynamic boundary condition results in the adjustment of the curvature of the interface near the wall. In our model, the 3D contact angle is computed based on the volume fraction and the contact line velocity, and is limited by the experimentally available advancing and receding static contact angles. Several 2D and 3D tests are presented, which demonstrate the accuracy of our model.},

abstract = {Outflow boundary condition (OBC) is a critical issue in computational fluid dynamics. As a type of numerical method for fluid flows, the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) method has gained much success in a variety of complex flows, and certain OBCs have been suggested for the LBE in simulating simple single-phase flows. However, very few discussions on the OBCs have been made for the two-phase LBE method. In this work, three types of OBCs that are widely used in the LBE for single-phase flows, i.e., the Neumann boundary condition, the convective boundary condition, and the extrapolation boundary condition, are extended to a two-phase LBE method and their performances are investigated. The comprehensive results of several two-phase flows show that these boundary conditions behave quite differently in the simulations of two-phase flows. Specifically, it is found that the Neumann boundary condition and the extrapolation boundary condition give rather poor predictions, while the type of convective boundary conditions work well, although the choice of the convection velocity has some slight influences on the results. We also apply these OBC schemes to some other two-phase models, and similar observations are found.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the lattice Boltzmann method has been widely used by scientists and en- gineers as an alternative to conventional numerical solvers for the Navier-Stokes equa- tions. The present work in this thesis aims at studying the lattice Boltzmann method for fluid dynamics from the kinetic point of view in contrast to macroscopic differential systems. And the main topics are concentrated on three aspects: theoretical back- ground of lattice Boltzmann method, boundary conditions as well as multiblock and multigrid methods. In the first part, the conceptual framework from statistical mechanics to fluid dynamics and the theoretical foundation for the lattice Boltzmann method are con- structed. Both Grad's representation approach and Chapman-Enskog expansion ap- proach are employed to derive the Navier-Stokes equations in fluid dynamics from Boltzmann - BGK equation. Different lattice structure in 1D, 2D and 3D are deduced from Gauss-Hermite quadrature. The general algorithm for lattice Boltzmann method as well as how to deal with compressibility effects and physical, dimensionless and lattice Boltzmann systems are summarized. The second part is devoted to investigating different methods for imposing boundary conditions, in particular Dirichlet boundary conditions, on both straight and curved boundaries for lattice Boltzmann method. The difficulties of imposing macroscopic boundary conditions on kinetic distribution functions accurately and stably are ad- dressed for straight and curved boundaries respectively, and two families of techniques under the name of “Distribution Modification” and “Distribution Reconstruction” are reviewed and presented with respect to these difficulties. In order to push the lattice Boltzmann method to more practical applications, where multiscale physical problem in complex geometry and large scale parallel computation come on the stage, the use ofmultiblock andmultigrid techniques is mandatory. Several multiblock and multigrid methods are examined and extended in the last part. Some basic ideas, such as overlapping and conservation laws, are borrowed from the field of domain decomposition and developed specifically for lattice Boltzmann method. Poiseuille flow, lid driven cavity flow, Womersley flow, Taylor-Couette flow, blood flow applications are taken as benchmarks throughout the thesis.},

@article{Jacqmin1999,
abstract = {Phase-field models provide a way to model fluid interfaces as having finite thickness. This can allow the computation of interface movement and deformation on fixed grids. This paper applies phase-field modeling to the computation of two-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. The Navier-Stokes equations are modified by the addition of the continuum forcing -C∇→$\phi$, where C is the composition variable and $\phi$ is C's chemical potential. The equation for interface advection is replaced by a continuum advective-diffusion equation, with diffusion driven by C's chemical potential gradients. The paper discusses how solutions to these equations approach those of the original sharp-interface Navier-Stokes equations as the interface thickness $\epsilon$ and the diffusivity both go to zero. The basic flow-physics of phase-field interfaces is discussed. Straining flows can thin or thicken an interface and this must be resisted by a high enough diffusion. On the other hand, too large a diffusion will overly damp the flow. These two constraints result in an upper bound for the diffusivity of O($\epsilon$) and a lower bound of O($\epsilon$2). Within these two bounds, the phase-field Navier-Stokes equations appear to generate an O($\epsilon$) error relative to the exact sharp-interface equations. An O(h2/$\epsilon$2) numerical method is introduced that is energy conserving in the sense that creation of interface energy by convection is always balanced by an equal decrease in kinetic energy caused by surface tension forcing. An O(h4/$\epsilon$4) compact scheme is introduced that takes advantage of the asymptotic, comparatively smooth, behavior of the chemical potential. For O($\epsilon$) accurate phase-field models the optimum path to convergence for this scheme appears to be $\epsilon$∝h4/5. The asymptotic rate of convergence corresponding to this is O(h4/5) but results at practical resolutions show that the practical convergence of the method is generally considerably faster than linear. Extensive analysis and computations show that this scheme is very effective and accurate. It allows the accurate calculation of two-phase flows with interfaces only two cells wide. Computational results are given for linear capillary waves and for Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. The first set of computations is compared to exact solutions of the diffuse-interface equations and of the original sharp-interface equations. The Rayleigh-Taylor computations test the ability of the method to compute highly deforming flows. These flows include near-singular phenomena such as interface coalescences and breakups, contact line movement, and the formation and breakup of thin wall-films. Grid-refinement studies are made and rapid convergence is found for macroscopic flow features such as instability growth rate and propagation speed, wavelength, and the general physical characteristics of the instability and mass transfer rates.},

These ultrahydrophobic surfaces are fabricated from silicon wafers using photolithography and are designed to incorporate precise patterns of microposts and microridges which are made hydrophobic through a chemical reaction with an organosilane. An experimental flow cell is used to measure the pressure drop as a function of the flow rate for a series of microchannel geometries and ultrahydrophobic surface designs. Pressure drop reductions up to 40{\%} and apparent slip lengths larger than 20 $\mu$m are obtained using ultrahydrophobic surfaces. No drag reduction is observed for smooth hydrophobic surfaces. A confocal surface metrology system was used to measure the deflection of an air-water interface that is formed between microposts and supported by surface tension. This shear-free interface reduces the flow resistance by allowing the fluid to contact only a very small effective area of the silicon surface. The impact of the surface topology on the drag reduction is explored in detail and the results are found to be in good qualitative agreement with the predictions of analytical theory.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

A series of benchmark two-dimensional simulations with the LBM are presented and analyzed in order to assess the impact of the LBM grid refinement on the results of the simulations. The considered cases include stationary and time-dependent flows past a circular or a 45-degree rotated square cylinder confined in the channel with parallel walls. Next, the same flow configurations are investigated by means of the Spectral Element Method (SEM) and obtained results are used to cross-validate both approaches. The sensitivity to the resolution of representation of the obstacle{\&}rsquo;s shape in the LBM simulations is of the main interest. Particular attention is paid also to the effects of compressibility of the flow. Additionally, for unsteady flows the transient flow characteristics are compared in detail: the velocity profiles from the LBM and SEM are presented and some non-dimensional characteristics such as Strouhal number of the compared von Karman vortex streets.},

In the method, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the convection-diffusion equation for the temperature field are solved separately by two different CLB equations. Through the Chapman-Enskog analysis, the macroscopic governing equations for incompressible thermal flows can be reproduced. The consistent forcing scheme (Fei and Luo, 2017) is adopted to incorporate forcing effect, and the implementation for CLBM is simplified by using simplified raw-moment sets. Compared with several D2Q5 multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann methods for the temperature equation, the proposed method is shown to be better Galilean invariant through measuring the thermal diffusivities on a moving reference frame. Numerical simulations for several typical problems confirm the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of the present method. The grid convergence tests indicate that the proposed CLBM for incompressible thermal flows is of second-order accuracy in space.},

abstract = {This paper presents an unsteady discrete adjoint algorithm for high-order implicit discontinuous Galerkin discretizations in time-dependent inviscid flow problems. The major function of the adjoint approach is to obtain the sensitivity information in a time-dependent functional output, which in turn is used to drive an unsteady shape-optimization process to deliver a minimum of the objective functional. A gradient-based optimization strategy is investigated, in which the sensitivity derivatives of the objective functional with respect to input variables are formulated in the context of high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations, while special emphasis is given to the variations and linearizations of curvilinear boundary elements. Implicit temporal discretizations consisting of a second-order backward Euler scheme and a fourth-order implicit Runge–Kutta scheme are considered exclusively in this work, where the corresponding adjoint problem is required to be solved in a backward time-integration manner due to the associated transpose operation. Two numerical examples for the unsteady shape design techniques are presented to verify the derived sensitivity formulations and to demonstrate the performance of the adjoint approach; the first involves an inverse shape-optimization case by matching a time-dependent target pressure profile for a two-dimensional periodic vortical gust impinging on a RAE-2822 airfoil, and the second considers minimization of the acoustic noise produced by subsonic flow over a NACA0012 airfoil with a 0:03c thick blunt trailing edge.

abstract = {Understanding the effect of surface roughness on gas flow in microchannels is highly desirable in microfluidic devices. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation is applied to investigate the effect of the surface roughness on slip flow of gaseous argon in submicron platinum channels. The geometries of the surface roughness are modeled by triangular, rectangular, sinusoidal and randomly triangular waves respectively. The results show that the boundary conditions of velocity slip, including slip, no-slip and negative slip, depend not only on the Knudsen number but also on the surface roughness. Induced by the roughness, the slip length of gas microflow over a rough surface is less than that predicted by the Maxwell model and shows a non-linear relationship with the Knudsen number. The friction coefficient increases not only with decreasing the Knudsen number but also with increasing the surface roughness. The impacts of the surface roughness and the gas rarefaction on the friction coefficient of gas microflow are strongly coupled. The roughness geometry also shows significant effects on the boundary conditions and the friction characteristics. The distortion of the streamlines and the enhancement of the penetrability near the rough surface are demonstrated to be responsible for the roughness effect. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We explain in detail the parallelization of these methods and describe a number of optimizations, mainly focusing on improving memory management and reducing the cost of host-accelerator communication. As previous research has consistently shown, pure LBM simulations are able to achieve good performance results on heterogeneous systems thanks to the high parallel efficiency of this method. Unfortunately, when coupling LBM and IB methods, the overheads of IB degrade the overall performance. As an alternative, we have explored different hybrid implementations that effectively hide such overheads and allow us to exploit both the multi-core and the hardware accelerator in a cooperative way, with excellent performance results.},

abstract = {The present study involves Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of a turbulent channel flow subject to passive-control of super-hydrophobic surfaces (SHS) employed in form of ridges/posts at the bottom-wall of the channel, oriented in transverse direction to the flow. The simulations have been carried out for a fixed friction Reynolds numberRe$\tau$=180 to investigate the effect of thermal forcing in tandem with SHS at a fixed friction Richardson numberRi$\tau$=15. It is observed that on decreasing the width to depth (w/d) ratio of the ridge topology, the drag-reduction increases and this reduction is found to be maximum for the topology of SHS posts. A key effect of this control is reduction in cross-flow fluctuations in the buffer-layer (i.e. 10{\textless}z+≤50) which lead to generation of weaker and more stable low-speed streaks which results in reduction in bursting of these near-wall streaks. This eventually causes considerable reduction in turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) which leads to turbulent skin-friction drag reduction at the controlled wall generally of the order of 10-22{\%}. Unstable-stratification of the SHS flow results in the wall-normal convection of turbulent-vorticity which enhances cross-flow fluctuations leading to an increase in Reynolds shear-stresses near to the bottom-wall. In total the effect of heating is found to mitigate the net-reduction produced in turbulent drag by 6-7{\%} for different cases employing ridge/post topology.},

abstract = {Reducing the friction of liquid flows on solid surfaces has become an important issue with the development of microfluidics systems, and more generally for the manipulation of fluids at small scales. To achieve high slippage of liquids at walls, the use of gas as a lubricant--such as microbubbles trapped in superhydrophobic surfaces--has been suggested. The effect of microbubbles on the effective boundary condition has been investigated in a number of theoretical studies, which basically show that on flat composite interfaces the magnitude of the slippage is proportional to the periodicity of the gaseous patterns. Recent experiments aiming to probe the effective boundary condition on superhydrophobic surfaces with trapped bubbles have indeed shown high slippage in agreement with these theoretical predictions. Here, we report nanorheology measurements of the boundary flow on a surface with calibrated microbubbles. We show that gas trapped at a solid surface can also act as an anti-lubricant and promote high friction. The liquid-gas menisci have a dramatic influence on the boundary condition, and can turn it from slippery to sticky. It is therefore essential to integrate the control of menisci in fluidic microsystems designed to reduce wall friction.},

abstract = {Lattice Boltzmann (LB) schemes based on the relaxation of central moments have recently proved valuable in simulating flows with an improved stability with respect to the original single-relaxation-time BGK formulation, while preserving the accuracy of the latter. This has been assessed mainly for flows in simple geometries, e.g. in periodic domains or with fixed rigid straight boundaries. In the present study, the properties of central-moment LB schemes have been investigated against flow configurations involving arbitrarily-shaped, possibly moving, boundaries within the framework of the so-called immersed boundary (IB) method. Namely, the presence of boundaries is accounted by an external force acting on the fluid that is encompassed in the central-moment LB algorithm. Accuracy and stability issues are examined in comparison with existing results from the literature and LB simulations based on the original BGK scheme. Our results show that central-moment LB schemes accompanied by the IB method provide an efficient tool for fluid???structure interaction simulations.},

abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann method has been widely used as a solver for incompressible flow, though it is not restricted to this application. More generally, it can be used as a compressible Navier-Stokes solver, albeit with a restriction that the Mach number is low. While that restriction may seem strict, it does not hinder the application of the method to the simulation of sound waves, for which the Mach numbers are generally very low. Even sound waves with strong nonlinear effects can be captured well. Despite this, the method has not been as widely used for problems where acoustic phenomena are involved as it has been for incompressible problems. The research presented this thesis goes into three different aspects of lattice Boltzmann acoustics. Firstly, linearisation analyses are used to derive and compare the sound propagation properties of the lattice Boltzmann equation and comparable fluid models for both free and forced waves. The propagation properties of the fully discrete lattice Boltzmann equation are shown to converge at second order towards those of the discrete-velocity Boltzmann equation, which itself predicts the same lowest-order absorption but different dispersion to the other fluid models. Secondly, it is shown how multipole sound sources can be created mesoscopically by adding a particle source term to the Boltzmann equation. This method is straightforwardly extended to the lattice Boltzmann method by discretisation. The results of lattice Boltzmann simulations of monopole, dipole, and quadrupole point sources are shown to agree very well with the combined predictions of this multipole method and the linearisation analysis. The exception to this agreement is the immediate vicinity of the point source, where the singularity in the analytical solution cannot be reproduced numerically. Thirdly, an extended lattice Boltzmann model is described. This model alters the equilibrium distribution to reproduce variable equations of state while remaining simple to implement and efficient to run. To compensate for an unphysical bulk viscosity, the extended model contains a bulk viscosity correction term. It is shown that all equilibrium distributions that allow variable equations of state must be identical for the one-dimensional D1Q3 velocity set. Using such a D1Q3 velocity set and an isentropic equation of state, both mechanisms of nonlinear acoustics are captured successfully in a simulation, improving on previous isothermal simulations where only one mechanism could be captured. In addition, the effect of molecular relaxation on sound propagation is simulated using a model equation of state. Though the particular implementation used is not completely stable, the results agree well with theory.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Physical Society. The primary and key task of binary fluid flow modeling is to track the interface with good accuracy, which is usually challenging due to the sharp-interface limit and numerical dispersion. This article concentrates on further development of the conservative Allen-Cahn equation (ACE) [Geier, Phys. Rev. E 91, 063309 (2015)10.1103/PhysRevE.91.063309] under the framework of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), with incorporation of the incompressible hydrodynamic equations [Liang, Phys. Rev. E 89, 053320 (2014)10.1103/PhysRevE.89.053320] . Utilizing a modified equilibrium distribution function and an additional source term, this model is capable of correctly recovering the conservative ACE through the Chapman-Enskog analysis. We also simulate four phase-tracking benchmark cases, including one three-dimensional case; all show good accuracy as well as low numerical dispersion. By coupling the incompressible hydrodynamic equations, we also simulate layered Poiseuille flow and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, illustrating satisfying performance in dealing with complex flow problems, e.g., high viscosity ratio, high density ratio, and high Reynolds number situations. The present work provides a reliable and efficient solution for binary flow modeling.},

@article{Liang2018,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a simple and accurate lattice Boltzmann (LB) model for immiscible two-phase flows, which is able to deal with large density contrasts. This model utilizes two LB equations, one of which is used to solve the conservative Allen-Cahn equation, and the other is adopted to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. A novel forcing distribution function is elaborately designed in the LB equation for the Navier-Stokes equations, which make it much simpler than the existing LB models. In addition, the proposed model can achieve superior numerical accuracy compared with previous Allen-Cahn type of LB models. Several benchmark two-phase problems, including static droplet, layered Poiseuille flow, and Spinodal decomposition are simulated to validate the present LB model. It is found that the present model can achieve relatively small spurious velocities in the LB community, and the obtained numerical results also show good agreement with the analytical solutions or some available results. At last, we use the present model to investigate the droplet impact on a thin liquid film with a large density ratio of 1000 and the Reynolds number ranging from 20 to 500. The fascinating phenomenon of droplet splashing is successfully reproduced by the present model and the numerically predicted spreading radius exhibits to obey the power law reported in the literature.},

While discrete adjoint methods usually rely on the use of the reverse mode of Automatic Differentiation (AD), which is difficult to apply to complex unsteady problems, our approach is based on the discrete adjoint equation directly and can be implemented efficiently with the use of a sparse forward mode of AD. We demonstrate the approach on the basis of a parallel, multigrid flow solver that incorporates various turbulence models. Due to grid deformation routines also shape optimization problems can be handled. We consider the relevant aspects, in particular the efficient generation of the discrete adjoint equation and the parallel implementation of a multigrid method for the adjoint, which is derived from the multigrid scheme of the flow solver. Numerical results show the efficiency of the approach for a shape optimization problem involving a three dimensional Large Eddy Simulation (LES).},

We consider the effective slip length which is defined with respect to the level of the mean height of the surface roughness. With increasing corrugation amplitude the effective no-slip boundary plane is shifted toward the bulk of the fluid, which implies a negative effective slip length. The analysis of the wall shear stress indicates that a flow circulation is developed in the grooves of the rough surface provided that the local boundary condition is no-slip. By applying a local slip boundary condition, the center of the vortex is displaced toward the bottom of the grooves and the effective slip length increases. When the intrinsic slip length is larger than the corrugation amplitude, the flow streamlines near the surface are deformed to follow the boundary curvature, the vortex vanishes, and the effective slip length saturates to a constant value. Inertial effects promote vortexflow formation in the grooves and reduce the effective slip length.},

abstract = {Two useful criteria are employed for comparing the super-hydrophobicity of surface designs from a wet-ting point of view. The first is the apparent contact angle at the transition point between the homogeneous (Wenzel) wetting regime and the heterogeneous (Cassie–Baxter) wetting regime. The second criterion is the wetted area of the solid surface in the heterogeneous wetting regime. Four different types of model rough surfaces are compared using the above criteria, in order to demonstrate optimization considerations in the design of super-hydrophobic surfaces. These model surfaces consist of protrusions of cylinders, truncated cones, paraboloids, and hemispheres. It appears that protrusions of very small base radii are not desirable, since they must be very high in order to conform to the first criterion. For higher base radii it seems that rounded protrusions, such as the paraboloids, are advantageous. This is an interesting conclusion, since the protrusions of the Lotus leaf are of a similar geometry. Based on the case of hemispherical protrusions it also appears that more than one geometrical degree of freedom is necessary in order to optimize a super-hydrophobic surface.},

A successful design of superhydrophobic surfaces requires a correct understanding of the influences of surface roughness on water-repellent behaviors. Here, a new approach, a mesoscale lattice Boltzmann simulation approach, is proposed and used to model the dynamic behavior of droplets impacting on surfaces with randomly distributed rough microstructures. The fast Fourier transformation method is used to generate non-Gaussian randomly distributed rough surfaces, with the skewness and kurtosis obtained from real surfaces. Then, droplets impacting on the rough surfaces are modeled. It is found that the shape of droplet spreading is obviously affected by the distributions of surface asperity. Decreasing the skewness and keeping the kurtosis around 3 is an effective method to enhance the ability of droplet rebound.

In the present contribution, numerical simulations of laminar flow past a superhydrophobic sphere are conducted using a two-phase flow representation. The results show drag reductions in Stokes flow of up to 19{\%} for an air-water system, in agreement with previous analytic work, and demonstrate an increased effect as the Reynolds number is increased to 100. Drag reductions of up to 50{\%} are achieved due to reduction in viscous drag and suppression of separation by the plastron, resulting in a narrower wake. To explore a less idealised model of the plastron, baffles have also been introduced to simulate the support of a plastron by roughness elements. The baffles lead to the attached vortex regime no longer being suppressed, but separation is delayed and drag reductions are evident in comparison to a solid sphere. Increasing the area solid fraction results in a diminished drag reduction due to the plastron, however drag reductions of up to 15{\%} can still be achieved with solid fractions of 10{\%}.},

The cascaded collision scheme was proved to increase the stability of the LBM in the case of fluid flow. Here we prove the enhanced stability and accuracy of the CTLBM scheme for thermal problems by comparing our results to traditional thermal BGK and MRT lattice Boltzmann methods. The proposed numerical scheme employs cascaded D2Q9model for fluid flow and cascaded D2Q5model for the temperature to study advection diffusion of sine wave and forced convection phenomena in forced cooling of a cylinder with heated core. To validate the proposed scheme, we compare our numerical results to the exact solutions of the sine wave advection-diffusion in 1D system for Peclet numbers between 102and 106. We also present comparisons of our CTLBM with BGK and two widely used MRT lattice Boltzmann methods for several lattice resolutions. For 2D case, we present numerical validation of forced cooling of a cylinder with heated core. To show the stability of the proposed CTLBM even for moderate lattice resolutions, we also present numerical simulations of forced convection across the row of hot tubes and double shear layer flow. The numerical simulations are faster and numerical results are in strong agreements with those available in the literature. The enhanced stability and accuracy of the cascaded scheme are clearly evident in the numerical results. Therefore, we show that the proposed CTLBM possesses higher stability and good accuracy with faster computation speed when compared to the other thermal BGK and MRT LBMs.},

abstract = {The discrete adjoint method allows efficient evaluation of the derivative of a function I(s) with respect to parameters s in situations where I depends on s indirectly, via an intermediate variable w(s), which is computationally expensive to evaluate. In this thesis two applications of this method in the context of computational fluid dynamics are considered. The first is shape optimisation, where the discrete adjoint approach is employed to compute the derivatives with respect to shape parameters for a performance functional depending on the solution of a mathematical flow model which has the form of a discretised system of partial differential equations. In this context particular emphasis is given to efficient solution strategies for the linear systems arising in the discretisation of the flow models. Numerical results for two example problems are presented, demonstrating the utility of the approach. The second application, in adaptive mesh design, allows efficient evaluation of the derivatives of an a posteriori error estimate with respect to the positions of the nodes in a finite element mesh. This novel approach makes additional information available which may be utilised to guide the automatic design of adaptive meshes. Special emphasis is given to problems with anisotropic solution features, for which adaptive anisotropic mesh refinement can deliver significant performance improvements over existing adaptive hrefinement approaches. Two adaptive solution algorithms are presented and compared to existing approaches by applying them to a reaction-diffusion model problem.},

abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann method offers an alternative framework compared to the Navier- Stokes simulations. However, the applicability of this method to simulate moving boundary problems has not received sufficient attention. In this work, different treatments of the no- slip condition of lattice Boltzmann method for the moving boundary problem of rigid and flexible wings flapping in a fluid have been analyzed. Schemes based on interpolation have been considered in the scope of flapping and plunging wing simulations to analyze the accuracy of the solution near the moving boundary. It is shown that interpolation resolves the exact location of the wall accurately when the distance from the nearest lattice, , unlike the halfway bounceback method. Flow past a vertically oscillating plate at = 100 with two different amplitudes is simulated. The presence of large fluctuations in forces, due to different levels of accuracy of pressure and velocity, at the time instant when an oscillating plate crosses into the adjoining lattice is shown. For a three-dimensional zero- thickness flat plate undergoing hovering motion with delayed rotation, interpolation schemes show better agreement with Navier-Stokes solution as compared to the halfway bounceback method. The flow field computed using interpolation indicates a continuous variation of pressure and vorticity near the surface of the wing. Lattice Boltzmann simulation of a finite- thickness flat plate is also shown to be in good agreement with the Navier-Stokes solution. Preliminary results of a two-link flexible wing model undergoing pitching and plunging motion are also presented. Through simulations using the flexible-particle model, good agreement with the force and deflection angle recorded in earlier experiments is reported. b},

The effect of the hydrophobic surface is considered to be a slip boundary condition on the wall, and this new boundary condition is added to Large Eddy Simulation (LES) equations. The predicted drag reduction at Re$\tau$= 180 is approximately 30, which concurs with results obtained from Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). An important implication of the present finding is that the near-wall turbulence structures are modified with streamwise slip velocity. In addition, a noticeable effect on the turbulence structure occurs when the slip length is greater than a certain value. {\textcopyright} 2012 Publishing House for Journal of Hydrodynamics.},

@article{Book2016,
abstract = {Most pumps operate at high Reynolds numbers, and, in this regime of flow, most of the hydraulic losses occur as a result of secondary flows and turbulent mixing. While a detailed analysis of secondary flows is beyond the scope of this monograph (the reader is referred to Horlock and Lakshminarayana (1973) for a review of the fundamentals), it is important to outline some of the more common secondary flows that occur in pumps. To do so, we choose to describe the secondary flows associated with three typical pump components, the unshrouded axial flow impeller or inducer, the shrouded centrifugal impeller, and the vaneless volute of a centrifugal pump. Secondary flows in unshrouded axial flow inducers have been studied in detail by Lakshminarayana (1972, 1981), and figure 1, which was adapted from those publications, provides a summary of the kinds of secondary flows that occur within the blade passage of such an impeller. Dividing the cross-section into a core region, boundary layer regions on the pressure and suction surfaces of the blades, and an interference region next to the static casing, Lakshminarayana identifies the following departures from a simple flow following the blades. First, and perhaps most important, there will be a strong leakage flow (called the tip leakage or tip clearance flow) around the blade tips driven by the pressure difference between the pressure surface and the suction surface. Clearly this flow will become even more pronounced at flow rates below design when the blades are more heavily loaded. This leakage flow will entrain secondary flow on both surfaces of the blades, as shown by the dashed arrows in figure 1. Second, the flow in the boundary layers will tend to generate an outward radial component on both the suction and pressure surfaces, though the former may be stronger because of enhancement by the leakage flow. The photographs of figure 2, which are taken from Bhattacharyya et al. (1993), show a strong outward radial component of the flow on the blade surface of an inducer. This is particularly pronounced near the leading edge (left-hand photograph). Incidentally, Bhattacharyya et al. not only observed the backflow associated with the tip clearance flow, but also a " backflow " at the hub in which flow reenters the blade passage from downstream of the inducer. Evidence for this secondary flow can be seen on the hub surface in the right-hand photograph of figure 2. Finally, we should mention that Lakshminarayana also observed secondary vortices at both the hub and the casing as sketched in figure 1. The vortex near the hub was larger and more coherent, while a confused Figure 1: Cross-section of a blade passage in an axial flow impeller showing the tip leakage flow, boundary layer radial flow, and other secondary flows (adapted from Lakshminarayana 1981). Figure 2: Photographs of a 10.2 cm, 12 • helical inducer with a lucite shroud showing the blade surface flow revealed by the running paint dot technique. On the left the suction surfaces viewed from the direction of the inlet. On the right the view of the pressure surfaces and the hub from the discharge. The flow is for 2000 rpm and $\phi$ 1 = 0.041. From Bhattacharyya et al. (1993). Figure 3: Schematic showing secondary flows associated with a typical centrifugal pump operating at off-design conditions (adapted from Makay 1980). interference region existed near the casing. Additional examples of secondary flows are given in the descriptions by Makay (1980) of typical flows through shrouded centrifugal impellers. Figure 3, which has been adapted from one of Makay's sketches, illustrates the kind of secondary flows that can occur at off-design conditions. Note, in particular, the backflow in the impeller eye of this shrouded impeller pump. This backflow may well interact in an important way with the discharge-to-suction leakage flow that is an important feature of the hydraulics of a centrifugal pump at all flow rates. As testament to the importance of the backflow, Makay cites a case in which the inlet guide vanes of a primary coolant pump in a power plant suffered structural damage due to the repeated unsteady loads caused by this backflow. Note should also be made of the secondary flows that Makay describes occurring in the vicinity of the impeller discharge. It is also important to mention the disturbed and separated flows that can often occur in the volute of a centrifugal pump when that combination is operated at off-design flow rates (Binder and Knapp 1936,},

abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate that periodic, micropatterned superhydrophobic surfaces, previously noted for their ability to provide laminar flowdrag reduction, are capable of reducing drag in the turbulent flow regime. Superhydrophobic surfaces contain micro- or nanoscale hydrophobic features which can support a shear-free air-water interface between peaks in the surface topology. Particle image velocimetry and pressure drop measurements were used to observe significant slip velocities, shear stress, and pressure drop reductions corresponding to drag reductions approaching 50{\%}. At a given Reynolds number,drag reduction is found to increase with increasing feature size and spacing, as in laminar flows. No observable drag reduction was noted in the laminar regime, consistent with previous experimental results for the channel geometry considered. The onset of drag reduction occurs at a critical Reynolds number where the viscous sublayer thickness approaches the scale of the superhydrophobic microfeatures and performance is seen to increase with further reduction in viscous sublayer height. These results indicate superhydrophobic surfaces may provide a significant drag reducing mechanism for marine vessels.},

abstract = {This paper presents an unsteady discrete adjoint algorithm for high-order implicit discontinuous Galerkin discretizations in time-dependent inviscid flow problems. The major function of the adjoint approach is to obtain the sensitivity information in a time-dependent functional output, which in turn is used to drive an unsteady shape-optimization process to deliver a minimum of the objective functional. A gradient-based optimization strategy is investigated, in which the sensitivity derivatives of the objective functional with respect to input variables are formulated in the context of high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations, while special emphasis is given to the variations and linearizations of curvilinear boundary elements. Implicit temporal discretizations consisting of a second-order backward Euler scheme and a fourth-order implicit Runge–Kutta scheme are considered exclusively in this work, where the corresponding adjoint problem is required to be solved in a backward time-integration manner due to the associated transpose operation. Two numerical examples for the unsteady shape design techniques are presented to verify the derived sensitivity formulations and to demonstrate the performance of the adjoint approach; the first involves an inverse shape-optimization case by matching a time-dependent target pressure profile for a two-dimensional periodic vortical gust impinging on a RAE-2822 airfoil, and the second considers minimization of the acoustic noise produced by subsonic flow over a NACA0012 airfoil with a 0:03c thick blunt trailing edge.

While discrete adjoint methods usually rely on the use of the reverse mode of Automatic Differentiation (AD), which is difficult to apply to complex unsteady problems, our approach is based on the discrete adjoint equation directly and can be implemented efficiently with the use of a sparse forward mode of AD. We demonstrate the approach on the basis of a parallel, multigrid flow solver that incorporates various turbulence models. Due to grid deformation routines also shape optimization problems can be handled. We consider the relevant aspects, in particular the efficient generation of the discrete adjoint equation and the parallel implementation of a multigrid method for the adjoint, which is derived from the multigrid scheme of the flow solver. Numerical results show the efficiency of the approach for a shape optimization problem involving a three dimensional Large Eddy Simulation (LES).},

abstract = {In this paper we present our algorithm for animating fluids with a free surface. It is based on the Lattice-Boltzmann Method, instead of a direct discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations. This allows a relatively simple treatment of the free surface boundary conditions at high computational efficiency, without sacrificing the underlying physics. We give a detailed description of our algorithm, focussing on details that are required to achieve a good visual appearance. Furthermore we describe how to implement our adaptive time stepping technique to achieve flexible and stable simulations. We will demonstrate the speed and capabilities of the method with animations from different interactive test cases. These run with, on average, more than 20 frames per second on a standard desktop PC.},

abstract = {The discrete adjoint method allows efficient evaluation of the derivative of a function I(s) with respect to parameters s in situations where I depends on s indirectly, via an intermediate variable w(s), which is computationally expensive to evaluate. In this thesis two applications of this method in the context of computational fluid dynamics are considered. The first is shape optimisation, where the discrete adjoint approach is employed to compute the derivatives with respect to shape parameters for a performance functional depending on the solution of a mathematical flow model which has the form of a discretised system of partial differential equations. In this context particular emphasis is given to efficient solution strategies for the linear systems arising in the discretisation of the flow models. Numerical results for two example problems are presented, demonstrating the utility of the approach. The second application, in adaptive mesh design, allows efficient evaluation of the derivatives of an a posteriori error estimate with respect to the positions of the nodes in a finite element mesh. This novel approach makes additional information available which may be utilised to guide the automatic design of adaptive meshes. Special emphasis is given to problems with anisotropic solution features, for which adaptive anisotropic mesh refinement can deliver significant performance improvements over existing adaptive hrefinement approaches. Two adaptive solution algorithms are presented and compared to existing approaches by applying them to a reaction-diffusion model problem.},

abstract = {Superhydrophobic surfaces should have high contact angles (CA) with water and low contact angle hysteresis (CAH). High CA may be achieved by increasing surface roughness, while in order to have low CAH, superhydrophobic surfaces should be able to form a stable composite interface with air pockets between solid and liquid. Capillary waves, nanodroplets condensation, hydrophilic spots due to chemical surface inhomogeneity, and liquid pressure can destroy the composite interface. These destabilizing factors have different characteristic length scales, so a hierarchical roughness is required to resist them. It is shown that convex rather than concave profile enhances stability, so nanoscale convex bumps should be superimposed over microasperities, in order to pin the liquid-air interface. In addition, the nanoroughness is required to support nanodroplets. The ability of the interface to support high pressure requires high asperity density and size, so it is in conflict with the requirement of low fractional solid-liquid contact area for low CAH and slip length. The new parameter, spacing factor for asperities, is proposed, and requirements for optimum design, which combines conflicting conditions, are formulated and discussed. Remarkably, biological superhydrophobic surfaces satisfy these requirements. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann method exhibits excellent scalability on current supercomputing systems and has thus increasingly become an alternative method for large-scale non-stationary flow simulations, reaching up to a trillion grid nodes. Additionally, grid refinement can lead to substantial savings in memory and compute time. These saving, however, come at the cost of much more complex data structures and algorithms. In particular, the interface between subdomains with different grid sizes must receive special treatment. In this article, we present parallel algorithms, distributed data structures, and communication routines that extend the software framework waLBerla in order to support large-scale, massively parallel lattice Boltzmann-based simulations on non-uniform grids. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of our approach on two current petascale supercomputers. On an IBM Blue Gene/Q system, the largest weak scaling benchmarks with refined grids are executed with almost two million threads, demonstrating not only near-perfect scalability but also an absolute performance of close to a trillion lattice Boltzmann cell updates per second. On an Intel-based system, strong scaling a simulation with refined grids and a total of more than 8.5 million cells is demonstrated to reach a performance of less than one millisecond per time step. This enables simulations with complex, non-uniform grids and four million time steps per hour compute time.},

abstract = {The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is a fully discrete mesoscopic method capable of simulating incompressible fluid flow. The method was discovered in 1988, further developed in the first half of the 1990's and reached full maturity in the last decade. The original LBM was extended in many ways, in the direction of multiphase flows, thermal flows, suspension flows, and to include turbulence, chemical reactions and solute transport. The basic theory of LBM for single-phase flow is well established, although even today research papers are being published that address subtle issues in the theory. Moreover, understanding of the embedding of the LBM in the broader context of the continuous Boltzmann equation, the macroscopic Navier Stokes equations, and microscopic theories is by now well understood. In this document the Lattice Boltzmann Method will first be introduced, followed by a theoretical demonstration that the model indeed mimics incompressible hydrodynamics. Next, the embedding of the method in both microscopic – and macroscopic theories will be clarified.},

abstract = {Fluid motion driven by thermal effects, such as that due to buoyancy in differentially heated three-dimensional (3D) enclosures, arise in several natural settings and engineering applications. It is represented by the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in conjunction with the thermal energy transport equation represented as a convection-diffusion equation (CDE) for the temperature field. In this study, we develop new 3D lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods based on central moments and using multiple relaxation times for the three-dimensional, fifteen velocity (D3Q15) lattice, as well as it subset, i.e. the three-dimensional, seven velocity (D3Q7) lattice to solve the 3D CDE for the temperature field in a double distribution function framework. Their collision operators lead to a cascaded structure involving higher order terms resulting in improved stability. In this approach, the fluid motion is solved by another 3D cascaded LB model from prior work. Owing to the differences in the number of collision invariants to represent the dynamics of flow and the transport of the temperature field, the structure of the collision operator for the 3D cascaded LB formulation for the CDE is found to be markedly different from that for the NSE. The new 3D cascaded (LB) models for thermal convective flows are validated for natural convection of air driven thermally on two vertically opposite faces in a cubic cavity enclosure at different Rayleigh numbers against prior numerical benchmark solutions. Results show good quantitative agreement of the profiles of the flow and thermal fields, and the magnitudes of the peak convection velocities as well as the heat transfer rates given in terms of the Nusselt number.},

The numerical scheme for solving the adjoint problem has many properties of the original system, including locality and explicit time-stepping. Thus it is possible to integrate it with the standard LBM solver, allowing for straightforward and efficient parallelization (overcoming limitations typical for the discrete adjoint solvers).

As previous research has consistently shown, pure LBM simulations are able to achieve good performance results on heterogeneous systems thanks to the high parallel efficiency of this method. Unfortunately, when coupling LBM and IB methods, the overheads of IB degrade the overall performance.

abstract = {A phase-field model is developed for quantitative simulation of bubble growth in the diffusion-controlled regime. The model accounts for phase change and surface tension effects at the liquid-vapor interface of pure substances with large property contrast. The derivation of the model follows a two-fluid approach, where the diffuse interface is assumed to have an internal microstructure, defined by a sharp interface. Despite the fact that phases within the diffuse interface are considered to have their own velocities and pressures, an averaging procedure at the atomic scale, allows for expressing all the constitutive equations in terms of mixture quantities. From the averaging procedure and asymptotic analysis of the model, nonconventional terms appear in the energy and phase-field equations to compensate for the variation of the properties across the diffuse interface. Without these new terms, no convergence towards the sharp-interface model can be attained. The asymptotic analysis also revealed a very small thermal capillary length for real fluids, such as water, that makes impossible for conventional phase-field models to capture bubble growth in the millimeter range size. For instance, important phenomena such as bubble growth and detachment from a hot surface could not be simulated due to the large number of grids points required to resolve all the scales. Since the shape of the liquid-vapor interface is primarily controlled by the effects of an isotropic surface energy (surface tension), a solution involving the elimination of the curvature from the phase-field equation is devised. The elimination of the curvature from the phase-field equation changes the length scale dominating the phase change from the thermal capillary length to the thickness of the thermal boundary layer, which is several orders of magnitude larger. A detailed analysis of the phase-field equation revealed that a split of this equation into two independent parts is possible for system sizes ranging from micrometers and above. The split of the phase-field equation leads to two equations controlling independently the phase change and the shape of the phase-field profile across the diffuse interface. A new algorithm is presented to solve a fully coupled model, including advection, phase change, and surface tension effects. Good agreement is found among numerical simulations, analytical solutions, and experimental results.},

abstract = {An investigation is made into the moving contact line dynamics of a Cahn–Hilliard–van der Waals (CHW) diffuse mean-field interface. The interface separates two incompressible viscous fluids and can evolve either through convection or through diffusion driven by chemical potential gradients. The purpose of this paper is to show how the CHW moving contact line compares to the classical sharp interface contact line. It therefore discusses the asymptotics of the CHW contact line velocity and chemical potential fields as the interface thickness $\epsilon$ and the mobility $\kappa$ both go to zero. The CHW and classical velocity fields have the same outer behaviour but can have very different inner behaviours and physics. In the CHW model, wall–liquid bonds are broken by chemical potential gradients instead of by shear and change of material at the wall is accomplished by diffusion rather than convection. The result is, mathematically at least, that the CHW moving contact line can exist even with no-slip conditions for the velocity. The relevance and realism or lack thereof of this is considered through the course of the paper. The two contacting fluids are assumed to be Newtonian and, to a first approximation, to obey the no-slip condition. The analysis is linear. For simplicity most of the analysis and results are for a 90° contact angle and for the fluids having equal dynamic viscosity $\mu$ and mobility $\kappa$. There are two regions of flow. To leading order the outer-region velocity field is the same as for sharp interfaces (flow field independent of r) while the chemical potential behaves like r−$\xi$, $\xi$ = $\pi$/2/max{\{}$\theta$eq, $\pi$ − $\theta$eq{\}}, $\theta$eq being the equilibrium contact angle. An exception to this occurs for $\theta$eq = 90°, when the chemical potential behaves like ln r/r. The diffusive and viscous contact line singularities implied by these outer solutions are resolved in the inner region through chemical diffusion. The length scale of the inner region is about 10[surd radical]$\mu$$\kappa$ – typically about 0.5–5 nm. Diffusive fluxes in this region are O(1). These counterbalance the effects of the velocity, which, because of the assumed no-slip boundary condition, fluxes material through the interface in a narrow boundary layer next to the wall. The asymptotic analysis is supplemented by both linearized and nonlinear finite difference calculations. These are made at two scales, experimental and nanoscale. The first set is done to show CHW interface behaviour and to test the qualitative applicability of the CHW model and its asymptotic theory to practical computations of experimental scale, nonlinear, low capillary number flows. The nanoscale calculations are carried out with realistic interface thicknesses and diffusivities and with various assumed levels of shear-induced slip. These are discussed in an attempt to evaluate the physical relevance of the CHW diffusive model. The various asymptotic and numerical results together indicate a potential usefullness for the CHW model for calculating and modelling wetting and dewetting flows.},

abstract = {Vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques have high probability of rupture and are characterized by non-homogenous temperature along the arterial wall. The non- homogeneous temperature is attributed to the accumulation of heat releasing inflammatory cells in the arterial wall. Rupture of the vulnerable plaque can lead to acute coronary syndrome and sudden cardiac death. Arterial wall thermography (AWT) can be applied to detect the presence of temperature hot spots along the arterial wall by using temperature measurement devices and provide an early detection of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. AWT, however, is invasive in nature. Computational fluid and heat transport models provide a more efficient and non-intrusive approach to examine the effect of plaque geometry and blood flow parameters on the thermal profile than in-vitro and in-vivo methods. A new thermal immersed boundary method is developed based on the thermal lattice Boltzmann method for the computational simulations of incompressible flows with heat transfer. The new approach is called direct forcing and heating immersed boundary lattice Boltzmann method (IB-LBM). A new and easier method of implementing the Neumann boundary condition and calculation of the local Nusselt number within the immersed boundary method computational framework was proposed and implemented. The new approach was validated with classical benchmark cases for natural convection and forced convection with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, there was good agreement between the results obtained using the proposed approach and published results in literature. The proposed direct forcing and heating IB-LBM was then applied to study the effects of blood flow parameters, plaque geometry (macrophage cell density and fibrous cap thickness), macrophage heat generation rate and arterial lumen stenosis on the surface temperature profile of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque.},

This expression is used to determine the properties of a flat interface between two coexisting phases. In particular, we find that the thickness of the interface increases with increasing temperature and becomes infinite at the critical temperature Tc, and that at a temperature T just below Tc the interfacial free energy $\sigma$ is proportional to (Tc−Tmath. The predicted interfacial free energy and its temperature dependence are found to be in agreement with existing experimental data. The possibility of using optical measurements of the interface thickness to provide an additional check of our treatment is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {We implement a phase-field based lattice-Boltzmann (LB) method for numerical simulation of multiphase flows in heterogeneous porous media at pore scales with wettability effects. The present method can handle large density and viscosity ratios, pertinent to many practical problems. As a practical application, we study multiphase flow in a micromodel representative of CO2invading a water-saturated porous medium at reservoir conditions, both numerically and experimentally. We focus on two flow cases with (i) a crossover from capillary fingering to viscous fingering at a relatively small capillary number, and (ii) viscous fingering at a relatively moderate capillary number. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons are made between numerical results and experimental data for temporal and spatial CO2saturation profiles, and good agreement is found. In particular, a correlation analysis shows that any differences between simulations and results are comparable to intra-experimental differences from replicate experiments. A key conclusion of this work is that system behavior is highly sensitive to boundary conditions, particularly inlet and outlet ones. We finish with a discussion on small-scale flow features, such as the emergence of strong recirculation zones as well as flow in which the residual phase is trapped, including a close look at the detailed formation of a water cone. Overall, the proposed model yields useful information, such as the spatiotemporal evolution of the CO2front and instantaneous velocity fields, which are valuable for understanding the mechanisms of CO2infiltration at the pore scale.},

abstract = {This paper presents an unsteady discrete adjoint algorithm for high-order implicit discontinuous Galerkin discretizations in time-dependent inviscid flow problems. The major function of the adjoint approach is to obtain the sensitivity information in a time-dependent functional output, which in turn is used to drive an unsteady shape-optimization process to deliver a minimum of the objective functional. A gradient-based optimization strategy is investigated, in which the sensitivity derivatives of the objective functional with respect to input variables are formulated in the context of high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations, while special emphasis is given to the variations and linearizations of curvilinear boundary elements. Implicit temporal discretizations consisting of a second-order backward Euler scheme and a fourth-order implicit Runge–Kutta scheme are considered exclusively in this work, where the corresponding adjoint problem is required to be solved in a backward time-integration manner due to the associated transpose operation. Two numerical examples for the unsteady shape design techniques are presented to verify the derived sensitivity formulations and to demonstrate the performance of the adjoint approach; the first involves an inverse shape-optimization case by matching a time-dependent target pressure profile for a two-dimensional periodic vortical gust impinging on a RAE-2822 airfoil, and the second considers minimization of the acoustic noise produced by subsonic flow over a NACA0012 airfoil with a 0:03c thick blunt trailing edge.

A basic feature of two-phase LBE models, i.e., the force balance condition at the discrete lattice level of LBE, is investigated in this work. An explicit force-balance formulation is derived for a flat interface by analyzing the two-dimensional nine-velocity (D2Q9) two-phase LBE model without invoking the Chapman-Enskog expansion. The result suggests that generally the balance between the interaction force and the pressure does not hold exactly on the discrete lattice due to numerical errors.

The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

abstract = {Entropic Lattice Boltzmann Method (ELBM) is used for the stable computational simulation of high Reynolds number fluid flows, due to it alleviates the obstacle of numerical instabilities by restoring the second law of thermodynamics (Boltzmann's H-theorem). In general, this stability is gained at the price of some computational overhead, associated with the requirement of adjusting the local relaxation parameter of the standard Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) in such a way as to guarantee compliance with H-theorem. In this paper, we present a very efficient implementation strategy for ELBM based high Reynolds number flow simulation on nVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU) with optimization approaches. Some algorithms for H-$\alpha$ solver on GPU which solve the relaxation adjusting parameter are also proposed in our study. We demonstrate the ELBM-GPU parallel approach for fluid flows simulation which can reduce the computational cost of ELBM implementation and obtain an excellent performance. Meanwhile, we find that the direct approximate method of parameter solution is more efficient than other methods on the whole. The results show that: (1) the whole ELBM-GPU implementation results in average speedups of 3.14 over the single-core ELBM-CPU result; (2) comparison of two types of methods for H-$\alpha$ solver, the direct approximate method can save an average 31.7{\%} of computation time than the iteration method; and (3) the implementation of ELBM on GPU allows us to achieve up to 50{\%} global memory bandwidth utilization ratio.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Physical Society. Based on phase-field theory, we introduce a robust lattice-Boltzmann equation for modeling immiscible multiphase flows at large density and viscosity contrasts. Our approach is built by modifying the method proposed by Zu and He [Phys. Rev. E 87, 043301 (2013)PLEEE81539-375510.1103/PhysRevE.87.043301] in such a way as to improve efficiency and numerical stability. In particular, we employ a different interface-tracking equation based on the so-called conservative phase-field model, a simplified equilibrium distribution that decouples pressure and velocity calculations, and a local scheme based on the hydrodynamic distribution functions for calculation of the stress tensor. In addition to two distribution functions for interface tracking and recovery of hydrodynamic properties, the only nonlocal variable in the proposed model is the phase field. Moreover, within our framework there is no need to use biased or mixed difference stencils for numerical stability and accuracy at high density ratios. This n ot only simplifies the implementation and efficiency of the model, but also leads to a model that is better suited to parallel implementation on distributed-memory machines. Several benchmark cases are considered to assess the efficacy of the proposed model, including the layered Poiseuille flow in a rectangular channel, Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and the rise of a Taylor bubble in a duct. The numerical results are in good agreement with available numerical and experimental data.},

abstract = {? 2015, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rigths reserved.In this paper, we present an unsteady aerodynamic and aeroacoustic optimization framework in which algorithmic differentiation (AD) is applied to the open-source multi-physics solver SU2 to obtain design sensitivities. An AD-based consistent discrete adjoint solver is developed which directly inherits the convergence properties of the primal flow solver due to the differentiation of the entire nonlinear fixed-point iterator. In ad- dition, a coupled CFD-CAA far-field noise prediction framework using a permeable surface Ffowcs Williams- Hawkings approach is also developed. The resultant AD-based discrete adjoint solver is applied to both drag and noise minimization problems. The results suggest that the unsteady adjoint information provided by this AD-based discrete adjoint framework is accurate and robust, due to the algorithmic differentiation of the entire design chain including the dynamic mesh movement routine and various turbulence model, as well as the hybrid CFD-CAA model.},

abstract = {Lattice Boltzmann Method introduces the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for solving transport phenomena – flow, heat and mass transfer – in a systematic way. Providing explanatory computer codes throughout the book, the author guides readers through many practical examples, such as: flow in isothermal and non-isothermal lid driven cavities;flow over obstacles;forced flow through a heated channel;conjugate forced convection; andnatural convection.Diffusion and advection-diffusion equations are discussed with applications and examples, and complete computer codes accompany the coverage of single and multi-relaxation-time methods. Although the codes are written in FORTRAN, they can be easily translated to other languages, such as C++. The codes can also be extended with little effort to multi-phase and multi-physics, if the reader knows the physics of the problem. Readers with some experience of advanced mathematics and physics will find Lattice Boltzmann Method a useful and easy-to-follow text. It has been written for those who are interested in learning and applying the LBM to engineering and industrial problems and it can also serve as a textbook for advanced undergraduate or graduate students who are studying computational transport phenomena.},

Adjoint methods are widely used in many areas including optimal control theory, de- sign optimization, variational data assimilation and sensitivity analysis. While numerous works in these areas discuss the methodology behind adjoint based gradient computation, details of this topic are frequently ommited leaving the actual implementation of the method as a bit of a mystery to those new to the subject. In this report we will give detailed explanations of how to compute the gradient of a cost function subject to PDE constraints by way of the discrete adjoint method. This is accomplished by providing simple examples from data assimilation to illustrate its use. In addition, we provide algorithms for com- puting the required Jacobian matrices on the fly, eliminating the need to store them as well as the need to explicitly derive the discrete adjoint problem.},

@article{Connington2012,
abstract = {A spurious current is a small-amplitude artificial velocity field which arises from an imbalance between discretized forces in multiphase/multi-component flows. If it occurs, the velocity field may persist indefinitely, preventing the achievement of a true equilibrium state. Spurious velocities can sometimes be as large as the characteristic velocities of the problem, causing severe instability and ambiguity between physical and spurious velocities. They are typically exacerbated by large values of numerical surface tension or when the two fluids being simulated have large density ratios. The resulting instability can restrict what parameters may be simulated. To varying degrees, spurious currents are found in all multiphase flow models of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). There have been many studies of the occurrence of the phenomenon, and many suggestions on how to eliminate it. This paper reviews the three main models of simulating multiphase/multi-component flow in the lattice Boltzmann method, as well as the subsequent modifications made in order to reduce or eliminate spurious currents.},

abstract = {Hierarchical laser-patterned surfaces were tested for their drag reduction abilities. A tertiary level of surface roughness which supports stable Cassie wetting was achieved on the patterned copper samples by laser-scanning multiple times. The laser-fabricated micro/nano structures sustained the shear stress in liquid flow. A rheometer setup was used to measure the drag reduction abilities in term of slip lengths on eight different samples. A considerable increase in slip length (111{\%} on a grate sample) was observed on these surfaces compared to the slip length predictions from the theoretical and the experimental models for the non-hierarchical surfaces. The increase in slip lengths was correlated to the secondary level of roughness observed on the patterned samples. The drag reduction abilities of three different arrangements of the surface features were also compared: posts in a square lattice, parallel grates, and posts in a hexagonal lattice. Although the latter facilitates a stable Cassie state, it nevertheless resulted in a lower normalized slip length compared to the other two arrangements at a similar solid fraction. Furthermore, we coated the laser-patterned surfaces with a silane to test the effect of surface chemistry on drag reduction. While the contact angles were surprisingly similar for both the non-silanized and the silanized samples, we observed higher slip lengths on the latter, which we were able to explain by measuring the respective penetration depths of the liquid-vapour interface between surface features.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the lattice Boltzmann method has been widely used by scientists and en- gineers as an alternative to conventional numerical solvers for the Navier-Stokes equa- tions. The present work in this thesis aims at studying the lattice Boltzmann method for fluid dynamics from the kinetic point of view in contrast to macroscopic differential systems. And the main topics are concentrated on three aspects: theoretical back- ground of lattice Boltzmann method, boundary conditions as well as multiblock and multigrid methods. In the first part, the conceptual framework from statistical mechanics to fluid dynamics and the theoretical foundation for the lattice Boltzmann method are con- structed. Both Grad's representation approach and Chapman-Enskog expansion ap- proach are employed to derive the Navier-Stokes equations in fluid dynamics from Boltzmann - BGK equation. Different lattice structure in 1D, 2D and 3D are deduced from Gauss-Hermite quadrature. The general algorithm for lattice Boltzmann method as well as how to deal with compressibility effects and physical, dimensionless and lattice Boltzmann systems are summarized. The second part is devoted to investigating different methods for imposing boundary conditions, in particular Dirichlet boundary conditions, on both straight and curved boundaries for lattice Boltzmann method. The difficulties of imposing macroscopic boundary conditions on kinetic distribution functions accurately and stably are ad- dressed for straight and curved boundaries respectively, and two families of techniques under the name of “Distribution Modification” and “Distribution Reconstruction” are reviewed and presented with respect to these difficulties. In order to push the lattice Boltzmann method to more practical applications, where multiscale physical problem in complex geometry and large scale parallel computation come on the stage, the use ofmultiblock andmultigrid techniques is mandatory. Several multiblock and multigrid methods are examined and extended in the last part. Some basic ideas, such as overlapping and conservation laws, are borrowed from the field of domain decomposition and developed specifically for lattice Boltzmann method. Poiseuille flow, lid driven cavity flow, Womersley flow, Taylor-Couette flow, blood flow applications are taken as benchmarks throughout the thesis.},

We propose a new account of how space-time mappings become activated in individuals' minds and entrenched in their cultures, the temporal-focus hypothesis: People should conceptualize either the future or the past as in front of them to the extent that their culture (or subculture) is future oriented or past oriented. Results support the temporal-focus hypothesis, demonstrating that the space-time mappings in people's minds are conditioned by their cultural attitudes toward time, that they depend on attentional focus, and that they can vary independently of the space-time mappings enshrined in language.

@article{Premnath2009a,
abstract = {Cascaded lattice-Boltzmann method (Cascaded-LBM) employs a new class of collision operators aiming to improve numerical stability. It achieves this and distinguishes from other collision operators, such as in the standard single or multiple relaxation time approaches, by performing relaxation process due to collisions in terms of moments shifted by the local hydrodynamic fluid velocity, i.e. central moments, in an ascending order-by-order at different relaxation rates. In this paper, we propose and derive source terms in the Cascaded-LBM to represent the effect of external or internal forces on the dynamics of fluid motion. This is essentially achieved by matching the continuous form of the central moments of the source or forcing terms with its discrete version. Different forms of continuous central moments of sources, including one that is obtained from a local Maxwellian, are considered in this regard. As a result, the forcing terms obtained in this new formulation are Galilean invariant by construction. The method of central moments along with the associated orthogonal properties of the moment basis completely determines the expressions for the source terms as a function of the force and macroscopic velocity fields. In contrast to the existing forcing schemes, it is found that they involve higher order terms in velocity space. It is shown that the proposed approach implies "generalization" of both local equilibrium and source terms in the usual lattice frame of reference, which depend on the ratio of the relaxation times of moments of different orders. An analysis by means of the Chapman-Enskog multiscale expansion shows that the Cascaded-LBM with forcing terms is consistent with the Navier-Stokes equations. Computational experiments with canonical problems involving different types of forces demonstrate its accuracy.},

abstract = {This thesis proposes a numerical model for simulating sediment transport phe- nomena. We call it a virtual river model. It is actually composed of a fluid and of sediments. The so-called lattice Boltzmann models describe the fluid. These models are defined for the document to be self-contained. This description is a good starting point for beginners but can also serves as a reference document for advanced read- ers. Boundary and flow settlement conditions are reviewed and a new boundary condition, which is mass conserving, is proposed and compared to existing ones conditions. To reach high Reynolds number, we use the so-called Smagorinsky model of turbulence which is clearly presented in the present lattice Boltzmann context. Mesh refinement techniques are reviewed and a more general algorithm is proposed. We define rules describing the behavior of the sediments. Then, we focus our attention on two applications: scour formation under submarine pipelines and meanders in rivers. Results of the first application are in agreement with the literature. We give an explanation at the mesoscopic level of the meandering process. Our preliminary results confirm our theory. To produce reusable and efficient implementations of our virtual rivers, we propose a parallel object-oriented environment for lattice based simulations called PELABS. Its performances are measured and analyzed. Due to its object-oriented architecture, we exhibit that, at worst, it is two times slower than a procedural implementation. Moreover, under certain conditions, it can be faster.},

abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann method for immiscible multiphase flows with large density ratio is extended to high Reynolds number flows using a multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision operator, and its stability and accuracy are assessed by simulating the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The MRT model is successful at damping high-frequency oscillations in the kinetic energy emerging from traveling waves generated by the inclusion of curvature. Numerical results are shown to be in good agreement with prior studies using adaptive mesh refinement techniques applied to the Navier-Stokes equations. Effects of viscosity and surface tension, as well as density ratio, are investigated in terms of the Reynolds and Weber numbers. It is shown that increasing the Reynolds number results in a more chaotic interface evolution and eventually shattering of the interface, while surface tension is shown to have a stabilizing effect.

While Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations cannot reach the low shear rates and large system sizes of the experiments, it is often impossible to resolve the needed details with macroscopic approaches. We model the interaction between hydrophobic channel walls and a fluid by means of a multi-phase lattice Boltzmann model. Our mesoscopic approach overcomes the limitations of MD simulations and can reach the small flow velocities of known experiments. We reproduce results from experiments at small Knudsen numbers and other simulations, namely an increase of slip with increasing liquid-solid interactions, the slip being independent of the flow velocity, and a decreasing slip with increasing bulk pressure. Within our model we develop a semi-analytic approximation of the dependence of the slip on the pressure.},

Fluids 23, 025102 (2011); 10.1063/1.3553278 In this paper, we demonstrate that periodic, micropatterned superhydrophobic surfaces, previously noted for their ability to provide laminar flow drag reduction, are capable of reducing drag in the turbulent flow regime. Superhydrophobic surfaces contain micro-or nanoscale hydrophobic features which can support a shear-free air-water interface between peaks in the surface topology. Particle image velocimetry and pressure drop measurements were used to observe significant slip velocities, shear stress, and pressure drop reductions corresponding to drag reductions approaching 50{\%}. At a given Reynolds number, drag reduction is found to increase with increasing feature size and spacing, as in laminar flows. No observable drag reduction was noted in the laminar regime, consistent with previous experimental results for the channel geometry considered. The onset of drag reduction occurs at a critical Reynolds number where the viscous sublayer thickness approaches the scale of the superhydrophobic microfeatures and performance is seen to increase with further reduction in viscous sublayer height. These results indicate superhydrophobic surfaces may provide a significant drag reducing mechanism for marine vessels.},

abstract = {In many different fields of research, the interactions between two immiscible fluids are of importance. To study these flows in industrial equipment, a multi-scale modeling approach is often used. In this approach, the smallest scale models apply detailed information in the form of closure equations for the larger scale models, which can model complete industrial equipment. This paper will focus on the improvement of the smallest scale model; direct numerical simulations employing the Volume of Fluid model. In this model, mass is inherently conserved because of the surface treatment, but this treatment also poses a challenge in calculating the surface properties like the surface tension. In this paper, three different surface tension models for the Volume of Fluid were tested: the generally used Continuum Surface Force (CSF) model, the height function model and the novel tensile force method. From the verification tests, it was concluded that both the height function model and the tensile force method are an improvement of the CSF model. The single bubble simulations showed that the height function method works best for small bubble (Eo{\textless}1). This is due to problems with connectivity for the tensile force method. While for the larger bubbles (Eo{\textgreater}10), the tensile force method is the best functioning surface tension model, because the calculation of the curvature in the height function method uses a stencil in which the distance between two interfaces in the direction of the normal should at least be 4 grid cells. In all the other tested cases, the height function model and the tensile force method perform equally well. The Morton number changes the ranges for the region of use of the surface tension models slightly when logMo≤−7 (the height function model can only be used when Eo≤2, while the tensile force method can only be used at Eo≥2) and logMo≥1 (the height function model can in this region also be used when Eo{\textgreater}10).},

However, the applicability of this method to simulate moving boundary problems has not received sufficient attention. In this work, different treatments of the no- slip condition of lattice Boltzmann method for the moving boundary problem of rigid and flexible wings flapping in a fluid have been analyzed. Schemes based on interpolation have been considered in the scope of flapping and plunging wing simulations to analyze the accuracy of the solution near the moving boundary. It is shown that interpolation resolves the exact location of the wall accurately when the distance from the nearest lattice, , unlike the halfway bounceback method. Flow past a vertically oscillating plate at = 100 with two different amplitudes is simulated. The presence of large fluctuations in forces, due to different levels of accuracy of pressure and velocity, at the time instant when an oscillating plate crosses into the adjoining lattice is shown. For a three-dimensional zero- thickness flat plate undergoing hovering motion with delayed rotation, interpolation schemes show better agreement with Navier-Stokes solution as compared to the halfway bounceback method. The flow field computed using interpolation indicates a continuous variation of pressure and vorticity near the surface of the wing. Lattice Boltzmann simulation of a finite- thickness flat plate is also shown to be in good agreement with the Navier-Stokes solution. Preliminary results of a two-link flexible wing model undergoing pitching and plunging motion are also presented. Through simulations using the flexible-particle model, good agreement with the force and deflection angle recorded in earlier experiments is reported. b},

abstract = {Contact angle hysteresis is an important physical phenomenon omnipresent in nature and various industrial processes, but its effects are not considered in many existing multiphase flow simulations due to modeling complexity. In this work, a multiphase lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is developed to simulate the contact-line dynamics with consideration of the contact angle hysteresis for a broad range of kinematic viscosity ratios. In this method, the immiscible two-phase flow is described by a color-fluid model, in which the multiple-relaxation-time collision operator is adopted to increase numerical stability and suppress unphysical spurious currents at the contact line. The contact angle hysteresis is introduced using the strategy proposed by Ding and Spelt [Ding and Spelt, J. Fluid Mech. 599, 341 (2008)JFLSA70022-112010.1017/S0022112008000190], and the geometrical wetting boundary condition is enforced to obtain the desired contact angle. This method is first validated by simulations of static contact angle and dynamic capillary intrusion process on ideal (smooth) surfaces. It is then used to simulate the dynamic behavior of a droplet on a nonideal (inhomogeneous) surface subject to a simple shear flow. When the droplet remains pinned on the surface due to hysteresis, the steady interface shapes of the droplet quantitatively agree well with the previous numerical results. Four typical motion modes of contact points, as observed in a recent study, are qualitatively reproduced with varying advancing and receding contact angles. The viscosity ratio is found to have a notable impact on the droplet deformation, breakup, and hysteresis behavior. Finally, this method is extended to simulate the droplet breakup in a microfluidic T junction, with one half of the wall surface ideal and the other half nonideal. Due to the contact angle hysteresis, the droplet asymmetrically breaks up into two daughter droplets with the smaller one in the nonideal branch channel, and the behavior of daughter droplets is significantly different in both branch channels. Also, it is found that the contact angle hysteresis is strengthened with decreasing the viscosity ratio, leading to an earlier droplet breakup and a decrease in the maximum length that the droplet can reach before the breakup. These simulation results manifest that the present multiphase LBM can be a useful substitute to Ba et al. [Phys. Rev. E 88, 043306 (2013)PLEEE81539-375510.1103/PhysRevE.88.043306] for modeling the contact angle hysteresis, and it can be easily implemented with higher computational efficiency.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Physical Society. Based on the phase-field theory, we propose a conservative lattice Boltzmann method to track the interface between two different fluids. The presented model recovers the conservative phase-field equation and conserves mass locally and globally. Two entirely different approaches are used to calculate the gradient of the phase field, which is needed in computation of the normal to the interface. One approach uses finite-difference stencils similar to many existing lattice Boltzmann models for tracking the two-phase interface, while the other one invokes central moments to calculate the gradient of the phase field without any finite differences involved. The former approach suffers from the nonlocality of the collision operator while the latter is entirely local making it highly suitable for massive parallel implementation. Several benchmark problems are carried out to assess the accuracy and stability of the proposed model.},

abstract = {The motion of coalescence-induced condensate droplets on superhydrophobic surface (SHS) has attracted increasing attention in energy-related applications. Previous researches were focused on regularly rough surfaces. Here a new approach, a mesoscale lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), is proposed and used to model the dynamic behavior of coalescence-induced droplet jumping on SHS with randomly distributed rough structures. A Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) method is used to generate non-Gaussian randomly distributed rough surfaces with the skewness (Sk), kurtosis (K) and root mean square (Rq) obtained from real surfaces. Three typical spreading states of coalesced droplets are observed through LBM modeling on various rough surfaces, which are found to significantly influence the jumping ability of coalesced droplet. The coalesced droplets spreading in Cassie state or in composite state will jump off the rough surfaces, while the ones spreading in Wenzel state would eventually remain on the rough surfaces. It is demonstrated that the rough surfaces with smaller Sks, larger Rqs and a K at 3.0 are beneficial to coalescence-induced droplet jumping. The new approach gives more detailed insights into the design of SHS.},

abstract = {The past decade saw a drastic increase in the understanding and applications of superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs). Water beads up and effortlessly rolls off a SHS due to its combination of low surface energy and texture. Whether being used for drag reduction, stain repellency, self-cleaning, fog harvesting, or heat transfer applications (to name a few), the durability of a SHS is critically important. Although a handful of purportedly durable SHSs have been reported, there are still no criteria available for systematically designing a durable SHS. In the first part of this work, we discuss two new design parameters that can be used to develop mechanically durable SHSs via the spray coating of different binders and fillers. These parameters aid in the rational selection of material components and allow one to predict the capillary resistance to wetting of any SHS from a simple topographical analysis. We show that not all combinations of sprayable components generate SHSs, and mechanically durable components...},

abstract = {Surface effects become important in microfluidic setups because the surface to volume ratio becomes large. In such setups the surface roughness is not any longer small compared to the length scale of the system and the wetting properties of the wall have an important influence on the flow. However, the knowledge about the interplay of surface roughness and hydrophobic fluid-surface interaction is still very limited because these properties cannot be decoupled easily in experiments. We investigate the problem by means of lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulations of rough microchannels with a tunable fluid-wall interaction. We introduce an ``effective no-slip plane'' at an intermediate position between peaks and valleys of the surface and observe how the position of the wall may change due to surface roughness and hydrophobic interactions. We find that the position of the effective wall, in the case of a Gaussian distributed roughness depends linearly on the width of the distribution. Further we are able to show that roughness creates a non-linear effect on the slip length for hydrophobic boundaries.},

abstract = {Vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques have high probability of rupture and are characterized by non-homogenous temperature along the arterial wall. The non- homogeneous temperature is attributed to the accumulation of heat releasing inflammatory cells in the arterial wall. Rupture of the vulnerable plaque can lead to acute coronary syndrome and sudden cardiac death. Arterial wall thermography (AWT) can be applied to detect the presence of temperature hot spots along the arterial wall by using temperature measurement devices and provide an early detection of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. AWT, however, is invasive in nature. Computational fluid and heat transport models provide a more efficient and non-intrusive approach to examine the effect of plaque geometry and blood flow parameters on the thermal profile than in-vitro and in-vivo methods. A new thermal immersed boundary method is developed based on the thermal lattice Boltzmann method for the computational simulations of incompressible flows with heat transfer. The new approach is called direct forcing and heating immersed boundary lattice Boltzmann method (IB-LBM). A new and easier method of implementing the Neumann boundary condition and calculation of the local Nusselt number within the immersed boundary method computational framework was proposed and implemented. The new approach was validated with classical benchmark cases for natural convection and forced convection with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, there was good agreement between the results obtained using the proposed approach and published results in literature. The proposed direct forcing and heating IB-LBM was then applied to study the effects of blood flow parameters, plaque geometry (macrophage cell density and fibrous cap thickness), macrophage heat generation rate and arterial lumen stenosis on the surface temperature profile of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque.},

This study attempts to investigate the bubble dynamics from a systematic and multiscale perspective, that is, progressively probing the behavior of a single bubble, a bubble pair, and a bubble swarm with a Multiple-Relaxation-Time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The MRT-LBM method is used to solve the phase-field model and can accurately capture the interface evolution under different flow conditions. This study also incorporates the force term in a different way, and the model is validated by classical numerical tests for a static bubble and capillary wave. Numerical tests show that the model is able to simulate the gas?liquid flows with a large kinematic viscosity ratio (up to 1000) and the bubbles of lower Morton number and higher Reynolds number. The simulation results of the terminal rise velocity of air bubbles are comparable with the classical experimental correlations. Interactions of two bubbles vertically or horizontally aligned are simulated, reproducing the trailing bubble catching up with the leading one for a vertically aligned bubble pair and the repeatedly bouncing and attracting phenomenon for a horizontally aligned bubble pair. The behavior of bubble pairs in a bubble swarm is analyzed with the model to understand the different bubble?bubble interactions and their influence on micromixing. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {A free-energy-based phase-field lattice Boltzmann method is proposed in this work to simulate multiphase flows with density contrast. The present method is to improve the Zheng-Shu-Chew (ZSC) model [Zheng, Shu, and Chew, J. Comput. Phys. 218, 353 (2006)] for correct consideration of density contrast in the momentum equation. The original ZSC model uses the particle distribution function in the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) for the mean density and momentum, which cannot properly consider the effect of local density variation in the momentum equation. To correctly consider it, the particle distribution function in the LBE must be for the local density and momentum. However, when the LBE of such distribution function is solved, it will encounter a severe numerical instability. To overcome this difficulty, a transformation, which is similar to the one used in the Lee-Lin (LL) model [Lee and Lin, J. Comput. Phys. 206, 16 (2005)] is introduced in this work to change the particle distribution function for the local density and momentum into that for the mean density and momentum. As a result, the present model still uses the particle distribution function for the mean density and momentum, and in the meantime, considers the effect of local density variation in the LBE as a forcing term. Numerical examples demonstrate that both the present model and the LL model can correctly simulate multiphase flows with density contrast, and the present model has an obvious improvement over the ZSC model in terms of solution accuracy. In terms of computational time, the present model is less efficient than the ZSC model, but is much more efficient than the LL model.},

abstract = {To improve the stability of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) at high Reynolds number the cascaded LBM has recently been introduced. As in the multiple relaxation time (MRT) method the cascaded LBM introduces additional relaxation times into the collision operator, but does so in a co-moving reference frame. This has been shown to significantly increase stability at low viscosity in the single phase case. Here the cascaded LBM is further developed to include multiphase flow. For this the force term is calculated by the interaction potential method, and introduced into the collision operator via the exact difference method (EDM). Comparisons are made with the lattice Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (LBGK) method, and an MRT implementation. Both the cascaded and MRT methods are shown to significantly reduce spurious velocities over the LBGK method. For the particular case of the Shan-Chen interparticle force term calculation with the EDM, the cascaded LBM is successfully combined with a multiphase method, and shown to perform as well as the more established MRT method. The cascaded LBM is found to be a considerably improved approach to the simulation of multiphase flow over the LBGK, significantly increasing the stability range of both density ratio and Reynolds number. Additionally the importance of including third order velocity terms in the equilibria of both the cascaded and MRT methods is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Since the half-way wall bounceback boundary condition is very easy to implement and was shown theoretically to give second-order accuracy for the 2-D Poiseuille flow with forcing, it is used with pressure (density) inlet/outlet conditions proposed in this paper and in Chen et al. to study the 2-D Poiseuille flow and the 3-D square duct flow. The numerical results are approximately second-order accurate. The magnitude of the error of the half-way wall bounceback is comparable with that using some other published boundary conditions. Besides, the bounceback condition has a much better stability behavior than that of other boundary conditions.},

In the seamless immersed boundary method for solving the Navier-Stokes equations, the forcing term which satises the velocity condition on the virtual boundary is added not only to the grid points near the boundary but also to the grid points inside the boundary, so that the pressure prole near the boundary becomes smoothly. Similarly in the present method, the external forcing function is added to the lattice Boltzmann equation. The present method is validated for the typical benchmark ows, e.g., ow around a circular cylinder and ow around a moving circular cylinder. As a result, it is conrmed that the present method gives the smooth pressure eld without the unphysical oscillation and pressure jump near the boundary.

abstract = {This paper presents an unsteady discrete adjoint algorithm for high-order implicit discontinuous Galerkin discretizations in time-dependent inviscid flow problems. The major function of the adjoint approach is to obtain the sensitivity information in a time-dependent functional output, which in turn is used to drive an unsteady shape-optimization process to deliver a minimum of the objective functional. A gradient-based optimization strategy is investigated, in which the sensitivity derivatives of the objective functional with respect to input variables are formulated in the context of high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations, while special emphasis is given to the variations and linearizations of curvilinear boundary elements. Implicit temporal discretizations consisting of a second-order backward Euler scheme and a fourth-order implicit Runge–Kutta scheme are considered exclusively in this work, where the corresponding adjoint problem is required to be solved in a backward time-integration manner due to the associated transpose operation. Two numerical examples for the unsteady shape design techniques are presented to verify the derived sensitivity formulations and to demonstrate the performance of the adjoint approach; the first involves an inverse shape-optimization case by matching a time-dependent target pressure profile for a two-dimensional periodic vortical gust impinging on a RAE-2822 airfoil, and the second considers minimization of the acoustic noise produced by subsonic flow over a NACA0012 airfoil with a 0:03c thick blunt trailing edge.

abstract = {Superhydrophobic surfaces are widely adopted for reducing the flow resistance in microfluidic channels. The structures on the superhydrophobic surfaces may consist of longitudinal grooves, transverse grooves, posts, holes, etc. In this paper their effective slip performances are systematically studied and compared in detail through numerical simulations. The numerical results show that channel wall confinement effects have a positive influence on the effective slip length for square posts and longitudinal grooves, and a negative influence for square holes and transverse grooves. Square posts, holes, and transverse grooves all exhibit deteriorating effective slip performances at higher Reynolds numbers, while the effective slip performance of longitudinal grooves remains independent of the Reynolds number. For small pattern width to channel height ratios and at low Reynolds numbers, for low shear-free fractions, the effective slip length of square posts is equivalent of that of transverse grooves, and both geometries yield effective slip lengths which are in turn lower than those of square holes and longitudinal grooves. With increasing shear-free fractions, the effective slip length of square posts surpasses that of square holes and longitudinal grooves, but it becomes lower than that of longitudinal grooves at high Reynolds numbers or large pattern width to channel height ratios. Scaling laws for the effective slip length of superhydrophobic surfaces with square posts, square holes, and transverse grooves have previously been reported for shear-driven flows. This study extends the validity of these scaling laws to pressure-driven channel flows, even at high Reynolds numbers. The findings in this study serve as a useful guide for applications involving the reduction in flow resistance in microchannels containing superhydrophobic surfaces.},

The effects of interface curvature on the effective slip length are quantified for different shear-free fractions and groove–rib spatial periods normalized using the channel height. The numerical results obtained demonstrate the importance of considering interface curvature effects in ascertaining the effective slip length. The effective slip length and performance of longitudinal grooves are compared with those corresponding to transverse grooves, for which analytical results are available for small shear-free fractions and normalized groove–rib periodic spacing. For the same shear-free fraction and interface protrusion angle, the effective slip length corresponding to the Poiseuille flow is found to be strongly affected by the normalized groove–rib spacing, in contrast to the Couette flow. For the Poiseuille flow, when the interface deforms by large protrusion angles into the liquid phase, the effective slip length approaches zero or becomes negative for large values of shear-free fraction and normalized groove–rib spacing due to significant flow blockage effects.},

abstract = {A free energy (FE) model, the ShanChen (SC) model, and the Rothman and Keller (RK) model are studied numerically to evaluate their performance in modeling two-dimensional (2D) immiscible two-phase flow in porous media on the pore scale. The FE model is proved to satisfy the Galilean invariance through a numerical test and the mass conservation of each component in the simulations is exact. Two-phase layered flow in a channel with different viscosity ratios was simulated. Comparing with analytical solutions, we see that the FE model and the RK model can give very accurate results for flows with large viscosity ratios. In terms of accuracy and stability, the FE model and the RK model are much better than the SC model. Co-current and countercurrent two-phase flows in complex homogeneous media were simulated and the relative permeabilities were obtained. Again, it is found that the FE model is as good as the RK model in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The FE model is shown to be a good tool for the study of two-phase flows with high viscosity ratios in porous media. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Physical Society. Based on the phase-field theory, we propose a conservative lattice Boltzmann method to track the interface between two different fluids. The presented model recovers the conservative phase-field equation and conserves mass locally and globally. Two entirely different approaches are used to calculate the gradient of the phase field, which is needed in computation of the normal to the interface. One approach uses finite-difference stencils similar to many existing lattice Boltzmann models for tracking the two-phase interface, while the other one invokes central moments to calculate the gradient of the phase field without any finite differences involved. The former approach suffers from the nonlocality of the collision operator while the latter is entirely local making it highly suitable for massive parallel implementation. Several benchmark problems are carried out to assess the accuracy and stability of the proposed model.},

As it is the basic fluid conveyance, the circular pipe and its influence on the circulating flow behaviour has been widely studied in the literature. 4.0.7 Hypotheses • Incompressible flow • Laminar flow • Newtonian flow • Cylindrical simmetry (∂ ∂$\theta$ = 0) • Negligible gravitatory effects • Steady flow (∂ ∂t = 0) • Very large pipe so that when flow becomes fully developed, v z = 0 but v $\theta$ = 0, v r = 0 • Smooth pipe so roughness does not influence 4.0.8 Physics of the problem The problem encompasses a L = 0.2 m length circular pipe with a diameter of D = 8 mm.

This has been assessed mainly for flows in simple geometries, e.g. in periodic domains or with fixed rigid straight boundaries. In the present study, the properties of central-moment LB schemes have been investigated against flow configurations involving arbitrarily-shaped, possibly moving, boundaries within the framework of the so-called immersed boundary (IB) method. Namely, the presence of boundaries is accounted by an external force acting on the fluid that is encompassed in the central-moment LB algorithm. Accuracy and stability issues are examined in comparison with existing results from the literature and LB simulations based on the original BGK scheme. Our results show that central-moment LB schemes accompanied by the IB method provide an efficient tool for fluid???structure interaction simulations.},

In this work, direct numerical simulation is used to investigate the drag reducing performance of superhydrophobic surfaces in turbulent channel flow. Slip velocities, wall shear stresses, and Reynolds stresses are determined for a variety of superhydrophobic surface microfeature geometry configurations at friction Reynolds numbers of Re$\tau$ 180, Re$\tau$ 395 and Re$\tau$ 590. This work provides evidence that superhydrophobic surfaces are capable of reducing drag in turbulent flow situations by manipulating the laminar sublayer. For the largest micro-feature spacing, an average slip velocity over 80{\%} of the bulk velocity is obtained, and the wall shear stress reduction is found to be greater than 50{\%}. The simulation results suggest that the mean velocity profile near the superhydrophobic wall continues to scale with the wall shear stress and the log layer is still present, but both are offset by a slip velocity that is primarily dependent on the microfeature spacing.},

abstract = {A general interface tracking method based on the phase-field equation is presented. The zero phase-field contour is used to implicitly track the sharp interface on a fixed grid. The phase-field propagation equation is derived from an interface advection equation by expressing the interface normal and curvature in terms of a hyperbolic tangent phase-field profile across the interface. In addition to normal interface motion driven by a given interface speed or by interface curvature, interface advection by an arbitrary external velocity field is also considered. In the absence of curvature-driven interface motion, a previously developed counter term is used in the phase-field equation to cancel out such motion. Various modifications of the phase-field equation, including nonlinear preconditioning, are also investigated. The accuracy of the present method is demonstrated in several numerical examples for a variety of interface motions and shapes that include singularities, such as sharp corners and topology changes. Good convergence with respect to the grid spacing is obtained. Mass conservation is achieved without the use of separate re-initialization schemes or Lagrangian marker particles. Similarities with and differences to other interface tracking approaches are emphasized. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The LB methods are shown to reproduce the diffusion slip phenomena. In the DSMC method, while fluid particles are diffusely reflected on a wall, significant component slip and a kinetic boundary layer are observed. It is shown that a higher-order LB method accurately captures the characteristics observed in the DSMC method.},

When a slip-boundary condition is used in the streamwise direction, the skin-friction drag decreases and turbulence intensities and turbulence structures, near-wall streamwise vortices in particular, are significantly weakened. When a slip-boundary condition is used in the spanwise direction, on the other hand, the drag is increased. It is found that near-wall turbulence structures are modified differently, resulting in drag increase. It is also found that the slip length must be greater than a certain value in order to have a noticeable effect on turbulence. An important implication of the present finding is that drag reduction in turbulent boundary layers is unlikely with hydrophobic surface with its slip length on the order of a submicron scale.},

abstract = {A series of experiments are presented which study the flowkinematics of water past drag-reducing superhydrophobic surfaces. The ultrahydrophobic surfaces are fabricated from silicon wafers using photolithography and are designed to incorporate precise patterns of micrometer-sized ridges aligned in the flow direction. The ridges are made hydrophobic through a chemical reaction with an organosilane. An experimental flow cell is used to measure the velocity profile and the pressure drop as a function of the flow rate for a series of rectangular cross-section microchannel geometries and ultrahydrophobic surface designs. The velocity profile across the microchannel is determined through microparticle imagevelocimetry ( $\mu$ -PIV) measurements capable of resolving the flow down to lengthscales well below the size of the surface features. Through these detailed velocity measurements, it is demonstrated that slip along the shear-free air-water interface supported between the hydrophobic micrometer-sized ridges is the primary mechanism responsible for the drag reduction observed for flows over ultrahydrophobic surfaces. A maximum slip velocity of more than 60{\%} of the average velocity in the microchannel is found at the center of the shear-free air-water interface whereas the no-slip boundary condition is found to hold along the surface of the hydrophobic ridges. The experimental velocity and pressure drop measurements are compared to the predictions of numerical simulations and an analytical theory based on a simple model of an ultrahydrophobic surface composed of alternating shear-free and no-slip bands with good agreement.},

This method combines the good features of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and the immersed boundary method (IBM) by using two unrelated computational meshes, an Eulerian mesh for the flow domain and a Lagrangian mesh for the solid boundaries in the flow. In this method, the non-slip boundary condition is enforced by introducing a forcing term into the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE). Unlike the conventional IBM using the penalty method with a user-defined parameter or the direct forcing scheme based on the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, the forcing term is simply calculated by the momentum exchange of the boundary particle density distribution functions, which are interpolated by the Lagrangian polynomials from the underlying Eulerian mesh. Numerical examples show that the present method can provide very accurate numerical results. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Superhydrophobic surfaces should have high contact angles (CA) with water and low contact angle hysteresis (CAH). High CA may be achieved by increasing surface roughness, while in order to have low CAH, superhydrophobic surfaces should be able to form a stable composite interface with air pockets between solid and liquid. Capillary waves, nanodroplets condensation, hydrophilic spots due to chemical surface inhomogeneity, and liquid pressure can destroy the composite interface. These destabilizing factors have different characteristic length scales, so a hierarchical roughness is required to resist them. It is shown that convex rather than concave profile enhances stability, so nanoscale convex bumps should be superimposed over microasperities, in order to pin the liquid-air interface. In addition, the nanoroughness is required to support nanodroplets. The ability of the interface to support high pressure requires high asperity density and size, so it is in conflict with the requirement of low fractional solid-liquid contact area for low CAH and slip length. The new parameter, spacing factor for asperities, is proposed, and requirements for optimum design, which combines conflicting conditions, are formulated and discussed. Remarkably, biological superhydrophobic surfaces satisfy these requirements. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann method has been widely used as a solver for incompressible flow, though it is not restricted to this application. More generally, it can be used as a compressible Navier-Stokes solver, albeit with a restriction that the Mach number is low. While that restriction may seem strict, it does not hinder the application of the method to the simulation of sound waves, for which the Mach numbers are generally very low. Even sound waves with strong nonlinear effects can be captured well. Despite this, the method has not been as widely used for problems where acoustic phenomena are involved as it has been for incompressible problems. The research presented this thesis goes into three different aspects of lattice Boltzmann acoustics. Firstly, linearisation analyses are used to derive and compare the sound propagation properties of the lattice Boltzmann equation and comparable fluid models for both free and forced waves. The propagation properties of the fully discrete lattice Boltzmann equation are shown to converge at second order towards those of the discrete-velocity Boltzmann equation, which itself predicts the same lowest-order absorption but different dispersion to the other fluid models. Secondly, it is shown how multipole sound sources can be created mesoscopically by adding a particle source term to the Boltzmann equation. This method is straightforwardly extended to the lattice Boltzmann method by discretisation. The results of lattice Boltzmann simulations of monopole, dipole, and quadrupole point sources are shown to agree very well with the combined predictions of this multipole method and the linearisation analysis. The exception to this agreement is the immediate vicinity of the point source, where the singularity in the analytical solution cannot be reproduced numerically. Thirdly, an extended lattice Boltzmann model is described. This model alters the equilibrium distribution to reproduce variable equations of state while remaining simple to implement and efficient to run. To compensate for an unphysical bulk viscosity, the extended model contains a bulk viscosity correction term. It is shown that all equilibrium distributions that allow variable equations of state must be identical for the one-dimensional D1Q3 velocity set. Using such a D1Q3 velocity set and an isentropic equation of state, both mechanisms of nonlinear acoustics are captured successfully in a simulation, improving on previous isothermal simulations where only one mechanism could be captured. In addition, the effect of molecular relaxation on sound propagation is simulated using a model equation of state. Though the particular implementation used is not completely stable, the results agree well with theory.},

abstract = {We present a new surface tension force formulation for a diffuse-interface model, which is derived for incompressible, immiscible Navier-Stokes equations separated by free interfaces. The classical infinitely thin boundary of separation between the two immiscible fluids is replaced by a transition region of small but finite width, across which the composition of the one of two fluids changes continuously. Various versions of diffuse-interface methods have been used successfully for the numerical simulations of two phase fluid flows. These methods are robust, efficient, and capable of computing interface singularities such as merging and pinching off. But prior studies used modified surface tension force formulations, therefore it is not straightforward to calculate pressure field because pressure includes the gradient terms resulting from the modified surface tension term. The new formulation allows us to calculate the pressure field directly from the governing equations. Computational results showing the accuracy and effectiveness of the method are given for a drop deformation and Rayleigh capillary instability. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Gerlach2006,
abstract = {The capabilities of three volume-of-fluid methods for the calculation of surface tension-dominant two-phase flows are tested. The accurate calculation of the interface remains a problem for the volume-of-fluid method if the surface tension force plays an important role and the density ratios of the fluids in different phases are high. The result can be an artificial velocity field at the interface ("parasitic currents"), which can destabilize the interface significantly. The three different algorithms compared can be distinguished by their methods to compute the surface tension force, namely, the method using a kernel function for smoothing the discontinuity at the interface, a combined level-set and volume-of-fluid approach and a parabolic reconstruction of surface tension. The test cases consist of an equilibrium rod, a capillary wave and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The analytical solutions for each problem serve to examine the accuracy and the convergence behavior of each approach. Finally, the slow formation of a gas bubble at an underwater orifice was computed with the combined level-set and volume-of-fluid method and the results are compared with an analytical solution based on the Young-Laplace equation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
