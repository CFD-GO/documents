abstract = {A boundary scheme in the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for the convection-diffusion equation, which correctly realizes the internal boundary condition at the interface between two phases with different transport properties, is presented. The difficulty in satisfying the continuity of flux at the interface in a transient analysis, which is inherent in the conventional LBM, is overcome by modifying the collision operator and the streaming process of the LBM. An asymptotic analysis of the scheme is carried out in order to clarify the role played by the adjustable parameters involved in the scheme. As a result, the internal boundary condition is shown to be satisfied with second-order accuracy with respect to the lattice interval, if we assign appropriate values to the adjustable parameters. In addition, two specific problems are numerically analyzed, and comparison with the analytical solutions of the problems numerically validates the proposed scheme. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

@article{Fakhari2016,
abstract = {A mass-conserving lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for multiphase flows is presented in this paper. The proposed LBM improves a previous model (Lee and Liu, 2010 [21]) in terms of mass conservation, speed-up, and efficiency, and also extends its capabilities for implementation on non-uniform grids. The presented model consists of a phase-field lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) for tracking the interface between different fluids and a pressure-evolution LBM for recovering the hydrodynamic properties. In addition to the mass conservation property and the simplicity of the algorithm, the advantages of the current phase-field LBE are that it is an order of magnitude faster than the previous interface tracking LBE proposed by Lee and Liu (2010) [21] and it requires less memory resources for data storage. Meanwhile, the pressure-evolution LBM is equipped with a multi-relaxation-time (MRT) collision operator to facilitate attainability of small relaxation rates thereby allowing simulation of multiphase flows at higher Reynolds numbers.Additionally, we reformulate the presented MRT-LBM on nonuniform grids within an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework. Various benchmark studies such as a rising bubble and a falling drop under buoyancy, droplet splashing on a wet surface, and droplet coalescence onto a fluid interface are conducted to examine the accuracy and versatility of the proposed AMR-LBM. The proposed model is further validated by comparing the results with other LB models on uniform grids. A factor of about 20 in savings of computational resources is achieved by using the proposed AMR-LBM. As a more demanding application, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) of a shear-layer flow is investigated for both density-matched and density-stratified binary fluids. The KHI results of the density-matched fluids are shown to be in good agreement with the benchmark AMR results based on the sharp-interface approach. When a density contrast between the two fluids exists, a typical chaotic structure in the flow field is observed at a Reynolds number of 10000, which indicates that the proposed model is a promising tool for direct numerical simulation of two-phase flows.},

We recall various elements of the state of the art for anti bounce back applied to linear heat and acoustics equations and in particular the possibility to take into account curved boundaries. We present an asymptotic analysis that allows an expansion of all the fields in the boundary cells. This analysis based on pure Taylor expansions confirms the well known behaviour of anti bounce back boundary for the heat equation. The analysis puts also in evidence a hidden differential boundary condition in the case of linear acoustics. Indeed, we observe discrepancies in the first layers near the boundary. To reduce these discrepancies, we propose a new boundary condition mixing bounce back for the oblique links and anti bounce back for the normal link. This boundary condition is able to enforce both pressure and tangential velocity on the boundary. Numerical tests for the Poiseuille flow illustrate our theoretical analysis and show improvements in the quality of the flow.},

@article{Chen2018,
abstract = {A high-order simplified thermal lattice Boltzmann method (HSTLBM) is developed in this paper for accurate and efficient simulation of incompressible thermal flows. The derivation of HSTLBM stems from the recently developed simplified thermal lattice Boltzmann method (STLBM) and incorporates high-order interpolation algorithms, which reflects an effective combination of local second-order reconstruction and global high-order scheme. By introducing virtual streaming nodes, HSTLBM decouples the streaming distance from the mesh spacing and then correlates them through high-order interpolation scheme. Delicate parametric studies indicate that adopting 5-point Lagrange interpolation and setting the streaming distance as 0.2 times of the mesh spacing could give optimal results which balances computational accuracy, stability, and efficiency well; and third-order of global accuracy can be achieved. HSTLBM inherits various merits of STLBM, especially its nice numerical stability. As a result, HSTLBM can give accurate and stable solutions on coarser meshes for problems at high Reynolds/Rayleigh numbers. Higher efficiency and lower memory cost can thus be expected. A series of benchmark tests are provided for comprehensive evaluation of HSTLBM in modelling two-and three-dimensional problems and on uniform/non-uniform meshes.},

In this work, CLBM is further extended to simulate thermal flows involving complex thermal boundary conditions and/or a heat source. Particularly, a discrete source term in the central-moment space is proposed to include a heat source, and a general bounce-back scheme is employed to implement thermal boundary conditions. The numerical results for several canonical problems are in good agreement with the analytical solutions and/or numerical results in the literature, which verifies the present CLBM implementation for thermal flows.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional double distribution function thermal lattice Boltzmann model has been developed for simulation of thermal compressible flows in the low Mach number limit. Both the flow field and energy conservation equation are solved by LB approach. A higher order density distribution function on standard lattices is used to solve the flow field, while an energy distribution function is employed to compute the temperature field. The equation of state of thermal perfect gas is recovered by higher order Hermite polynomial expansions in Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations. The equilibrium distribution functions of D3Q15, D3Q19 and D3Q27 lattices are obtained from the Hermite expansion. They exhibit slight differences originating in differences in the discrete lattice symmetries. The correction terms in LB models for third order derivation are added using an external force in orthogonal polynomials form. Present models are successfully assessed considering several test cases, namely the thermal Couette flow, Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection, natural convection in square cavity and a spherical explosion in a 3D enclosed box. The numerical results are in good agreement with both analytical solution and results given by previous authors.},

The continuity of temperature (concentration) and its flux at the interface for heat (mass) transfer is intrinsically satisfied without iterative computations, and the interfacial temperature (concentration) and their fluxes are conveniently obtained from the microscopic distribution functions without finite-difference calculations. The present treatment takes into account the local geometry of the interface so that it can be directly applied to curved interface problems such as conjugate heat and mass transfer in porous media. For straight interfaces or curved interfaces with no tangential gradient, the coupling between the interfacial fluxes along the discrete lattice velocity directions is eliminated and thus the proposed interface schemes can be greatly simplified. Several numerical tests are conducted to verify the applicability and accuracy of the proposed conjugate interface treatment, including (i) steady convection-diffusion in a channel containing two different fluids, (ii) unsteady convection-diffusion in the channel, (iii) steady heat conduction inside a circular domain with two different solid materials, and (iv) unsteady mass transfer from a spherical droplet in an extensional creeping flow.

abstract = {Abstract In this work we propose an interface treatment for conjugate heat and mass transfer with discontinuities or jumps of temperature (concentration) and/or heat (mass) flux at the interface using the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) method. The present interface treatment is based on the second-order accurate boundary condition treatments for Dirichlet and Neumann problems (Li et al., 2013) and second-order accurate interface treatment for standard conjugate heat and mass transfer with the continuity of temperature (concentration) and flux at the interface (Li et al., 2014). The interfacial jump conditions are intrinsically satisfied in the present treatment without iterative computations that are typically needed in conventional finite-difference or finite-volume methods. The interfacial temperature (concentration) values and the fluxes into the adjacent domains are conveniently obtained from the microscopic distribution functions in the LBE model without finite-difference approximations. Since the local intersection link fraction is included in the present treatment, the interfacial geometry is preserved and the present interface schemes are capable of handling curved interfaces. The numerical accuracy and convergence of the present interface schemes are verified with several numerical tests, including (i) one-dimensional (1D) steady diffusion within a two-solid slab; the slab is either aligned with the lattice velocity vector or with an inclination angle, (ii) 2D steady diffusion in a circular domain of two concentric solids, (iii) 3D steady diffusion in a spherical domain of two concentric solids, and (iv) 2D steady convection-diffusion in a channel. The two adjacent domains have different thermal (mass) transport properties and specific temperature (concentration) and flux jump conditions are imposed at the interface in each of those tests. It is verified that the present interface treatment for jump conditions does not introduce additional errors compared to the case without jumps; and second-order accuracy in space is obtained for the interior temperature (concentration) field, the interfacial temperature (concentration) values and interfacial fluxes for straight interfaces aligned with the lattice velocity vector in both diffusion and convection-diffusion problems. The effects of inclined and curved interfacial geometry on the order-of-accuracy of the LBE results are also investigated and the results are compared with previous findings.},

A series of numerical tests show that this convective outflow treatment yields solutions compatible with experiments and other numerical results. With respect to other outflow conditions concerned with zero derivatives, such as the Do-nothing condition, Grad's approximation and a modified extrapolation method, a comparison is numerically carried out into the aspects of the condition's influence on the interior of the flow, the mass balance, the perturbation and the reflection at the outflow.

As a type of numerical method for fluid flows, the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) method has gained much success in a variety of complex flows, and certain OBCs have been suggested for the LBE in simulating simple single-phase flows. However, very few discussions on the OBCs have been made for the two-phase LBE method. In this work, three types of OBCs that are widely used in the LBE for single-phase flows, i.e., the Neumann boundary condition, the convective boundary condition, and the extrapolation boundary condition, are extended to a two-phase LBE method and their performances are investigated. The comprehensive results of several two-phase flows show that these boundary conditions behave quite differently in the simulations of two-phase flows. Specifically, it is found that the Neumann boundary condition and the extrapolation boundary condition give rather poor predictions, while the type of convective boundary conditions work well, although the choice of the convection velocity has some slight influences on the results. We also apply these OBC schemes to some other two-phase models, and similar observations are found.},

In addition to average Nusselt number, the effects of Re, Pr and thermal boundary conditions on the temperature field near the cylinder and on the local Nusselt number distributions have also been presented to provide further physical insights into the nature of the flow.

abstract = {The immersed boundary (IB) method originated by Peskin has been popular in modeling and simulating problems involving the interaction of a flexible structure and a viscous incompressible fluid. The NavierStokes (NS) equations in the IB method are usually solved using numerical methods such as FFT and projection methods. Here in our work, the NS equations are solved by an alternative approach, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). Compared to many conventional NS solvers, the LBM can be easier to implement and more convenient for modeling additional physics in a problem. This alternative approach adds extra versatility to the immersed boundary method. In this paper we discuss the use of a 3D lattice Boltzmann model (D3Q19) within the IB method. We use this hybrid approach to simulate a viscous flow past a flexible sheet tethered at its middle line in a 3D channel and determine a drag scaling law for the sheet. Our main conclusions are: (1) the hybrid method is convergent with first-order accuracy which is consistent with the immersed boundary method in general; (2) the drag of the flexible sheet appears to scale with the inflow speed which is in sharp contrast with the square law for a rigid body in a viscous flow. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The results obtained by the LBE method are compared with the existing data. We observe that the LBE with either the IBB or IB methods for the no-slip boundary conditions exhibits a second-order rate of convergence. While the computational cost for both methods are comparable, the interpolated bounce-back method is more accurate than the immersed-boundary method with the same mesh size. Consequently the IBB method is more efficient computationally, while the IB method is easier to implement.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the mathematical structure of the immersed boundary (IB) method, which is intended for the computer simulation of fluid–structure interaction, especially in biological fluid dynamics. The IB formulation of such problems, derived here from the principle of least ac- tion, involves both Eulerian and Lagrangian variables, linked by the Dirac delta function. Spatial discretization of the IB equations is based on a fixed Cartesian mesh for the Eulerian variables, and a moving curvilinear mesh for the Lagrangian variables. The two types of variables are linked by interaction equations that involve a smoothed approximation to the Dirac delta function. Eulerian/Lagrangian identities govern the transfer of data from one mesh to the other. Temporal discretization is by a second-order Runge–Kutta method. Current and future research directions are pointed out, and applications of the IB method are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {In the present paper, we verify the effectiveness of the two-relaxation-time (TRT) collision operator in reducing boundary slip computed by the immersed boundary–lattice Boltzmann method (IB-LBM). In the linear collision operator of the TRT, we decompose the distribution function into symmetric and antisymmetric components and define the relaxation parameters for each part. The Chapman-Enskog expansion indicates that one relaxation time for the symmetric component is related to the kinematic viscosity. Rigorous analysis of the symmetric shear flows reveals that the relaxation time for the antisymmetric part controls the velocity gradient, the boundary velocity, and the boundary slip velocity computed by the IB-LBM. Simulation of the symmetric shear flows, the symmetric Poiseuille flows, and the cylindrical Couette flows indicates that the profiles of the numerical velocity calculated by the TRT collision operator under the IB-LBM framework exactly agree with those of the multirelaxation time (MRT). The TRT is as effective in removing the boundary slip as the MRT. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that the error of the boundary velocity is caused by the smoothing technique using the $\delta$ function used in the interpolation method. In the simulation of the flow past a circular cylinder, the IB-LBM based on the implicit correction method with the TRT succeeds in preventing the flow penetration through the solid surface as well as unphysical velocity distortion. The drag coefficient, the wake length, and the separation points calculated by the present IB-LBM agree well with previous studies at Re = 10, 20, and 40.},

To reduce such a numerical boundary slip, an immerse boundary lattice Boltzmann model based on multiple relaxation times is proposed in this paper.

@article{Hecht2008,
abstract = {On-site boundary conditions are often desired for lattice Boltzmann simulations of fluid flow in complex geometries such as porous media or microfluidic devices. The possibility to specify the exact position of the boundary, independent of other simulation parameters, simplifies the analysis of the system. For practical applications it should allow to freely specify the direction of the flux, and it should be straight forward to implement in three dimensions. Furthermore, especially for parallelized solvers it is of great advantage if the boundary condition can be applied locally, involving only information available on the current lattice site. We meet this need by describing in detail how to transfer the approach suggested by Zou and He to a D3Q19 lattice. The boundary condition acts locally, is independent of the details of the relaxation process during collision and contains no artificial slip. In particular, the case of an on-site no-slip boundary condition is naturally included. We test the boundary condition in several setups and confirm that it is capable to accurately model the velocity field up to second order and does not contain any numerical slip.},

abstract = {This paper reviews applications of the lattice-Boltzmann method to simulations of particle-fluid suspensions. We first summarize the available simulation methods for colloidal suspensions together with some of the important applications of these methods, and then describe results from lattice-gas and lattice-Boltzmann simulations in more detail. The remainder of the paper is an update of previously published work, (69, 70) taking into account recent research by ourselves and other groups. We describe a lattice-Boltzmann model that can take proper account of density fluctuations in the fluid, which may be important in describing the short-time dynamics of colloidal particles. We then derive macro-dynamical equations for a collision operator with separate shear and bulk viscosities , via the usual multi-timescale expansion. A careful examination of the second-order equations shows that inclusion of an external force, such as a pressure gradient, requires terms that depend on the eigenvalues of the collision operator. Alternatively, the momentum density must be redefined to include a contribution from the external force. Next, we summarize recent innovations and give a few numerical examples to illustrate critical issues. Finally, we derive the equations for a lattice-Boltzmann model that includes transverse and longitudinal fluctuations in momentum. The model leads to a discrete version of the Green-Kubo relations for the shear and bulk viscosity, which agree with the viscosities obtained from the macro-dynamical analysis. We believe that inclusion of longitudinal fluctuations will improve the equipartition of energy in lattice-Boltzmann simulations of colloidal suspensions.},

abstract = {In this study, we assess several interface schemes for stationary complex boundary flows under the direct-forcing immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann methods (IB-LBM) based on a split-forcing lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE). Our strategy is to couple various interface schemes, which were adopted in the previous direct-forcing immersed boundary methods (IBM), with the split-forcing LBE, which enables us to directly use the direct-forcing concept in the lattice Boltzmann calculation algorithm with a second-order accuracy without involving the Navier–Stokes equation. In this study, we investigate not only common diffuse interface schemes but also a sharp interface scheme. For the diffuse interface scheme, we consider explicit and implicit interface schemes. In the calculation of velocity interpolation and force distribution, we use the 2- and 4-point discrete delta functions, which give the second-order approximation. For the sharp interface scheme, we deal with the exterior sharp interface scheme, where we impose the force density on exterior (solid) nodes nearest to the boundary. All tested schemes show a second-order overall accuracy when the simulation results of the Taylor–Green decaying vortex are compared with the analytical solutions. It is also confirmed that for stationary complex boundary flows, the sharper the interface scheme, the more accurate the results are. In the simulation of flows past a circular cylinder, the results from each interface scheme are comparable to those from other corresponding numerical schemes.

The confined unsteady laminar flow past a square cylinder is used as test case due to the continuous vortex shedding generated in the wake of the cylinder. Three different approaches to treat open boundaries are considered as they are expected to be representative of the most common ones typically used in LB. We conclude that lattice Boltzmann methods suffer from the same problems with open boundaries as other compressible or pseudo-compressible approximations for the numerical solution of fluid flows: these boundaries reflect pressure waves and these have a relevant influence on the solution and convergence rate of both steady and unsteady flows, even at very low Reynolds numbers. However, practical solutions considering zero derivatives at the outflow or non-reflecting boundaries are possible. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Various ways of implementing boundary conditions for the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations by a lattice Boltzmann method are discussed. Five commonly adopted approaches are reviewed, analyzed, and compared, including local and nonlocal methods. The discussion is restricted to velocity Dirichlet boundary conditions, and to straight on-lattice boundaries which are aligned with the horizontal and vertical lattice directions. The boundary conditions are first inspected analytically by applying systematically the results of a multiscale analysis to boundary nodes. This procedure makes it possible to compare boundary conditions on an equal footing, although they were originally derived from very different principles. It is concluded that all five boundary conditions exhibit second-order accuracy, consistent with the accuracy of the lattice Boltzmann method. The five methods are then compared numerically for accuracy and stability through benchmarks of two-dimensional and three-dimensional flows. None of the methods is found to be throughout superior to the others. Instead, the choice of a best boundary condition depends on the flow geometry, and on the desired trade-off between accuracy and stability. From the findings of the benchmarks, the boundary conditions can be classified into two major groups. The first group comprehends boundary conditions that preserve the information streaming from the bulk into boundary nodes and complete the missing information through closure relations. Boundary conditions in this group are found to be exceptionally accurate at low Reynolds number. Boundary conditions of the second group replace all variables on boundary nodes by new values. They exhibit generally much better numerical stability and are therefore dedicated for use in high Reynolds number flows.},

abstract = {By realizing the insufficient degree of Galilean invariance of the traditional multiple-relaxation-time collision operators, Geier [Phys. Rev. E 73, 066705 (2006)] proposed to relax differently the moments shifted by the macroscopic velocity, leading to the so-called cascaded lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). This paper points out that (a) the cascaded LBM essentially consists in adopting a generalized local equilibrium in the frame at rest; (b) this new equilibrium does not affect the consistency of LBM; and finally (c) if the raw moments are relaxed in the frame at rest as usual and the number of relaxation frequencies is reduced, the proposed derivation leads to the two-relaxation-time collisional operator with proper polynomial equilibrium.},

abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann method for immiscible multiphase flows with large density ratio is extended to high Reynolds number flows using a multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision operator, and its stability and accuracy are assessed by simulating the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The MRT model is successful at damping high-frequency oscillations in the kinetic energy emerging from traveling waves generated by the inclusion of curvature. Numerical results are shown to be in good agreement with prior studies using adaptive mesh refinement techniques applied to the Navier-Stokes equations. Effects of viscosity and surface tension, as well as density ratio, are investigated in terms of the Reynolds and Weber numbers. It is shown that increasing the Reynolds number results in a more chaotic interface evolution and eventually shattering of the interface, while surface tension is shown to have a stabilizing effect.

abstract = {The mechanism of drag reduction by using superhydrophobic surfaces whose contact angle is greater than 150° is still an open problem that needs to be investigated. The main purpose of this paper is to reveal how the pressure drop can be decreased. The lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) is employed to investigate fluid flows through channels with different wettability conditions and topographical surfaces. The drag reduction by superhydrophobic surfaces is determined based on numerical experiments. For the smooth-surface flow, a very thin gas film is observed between the fluid and the superhydrophobic wall; hence, the liquid/solid interface is replaced by the gas/liquid interface. For the rough-surface flow, liquid sweeps over the grooves and the contact area is reduced; therefore, the friction is decreased rapidly. Additionally, the effects of surface wettability and surface roughness are analyzed as well. It is found that introducing roughness elements has a positive effect for reducing the pressure drop for the hydrophobic-surface flow, but has a negative effect for the hydrophilic-surface flow. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Zu2013,
abstract = {A lattice Boltzmann model (LBM) is proposed based on the phase-field theory to simulate incompressible binary fluids with density and viscosity contrasts. Unlike many existing diffuse interface models which are limited to density matched binary fluids, the proposed model is capable of dealing with binary fluids with moderate density ratios. A new strategy for projecting the phase field to the viscosity field is proposed on the basis of the continuity of viscosity flux. The new LBM utilizes two lattice Boltzmann equations (LBEs): one for the interface tracking and the other for solving the hydrodynamic properties. The LBE for interface tracking can recover the Chan-Hilliard equation without any additional terms; while the LBE for hydrodynamic properties can recover the exact form of the divergence-free incompressible Navier-Stokes equations avoiding spurious interfacial forces. A series of 2D and 3D benchmark tests have been conducted for validation, which include a rigid-body rotation, stationary and moving droplets, a spinodal decomposition, a buoyancy-driven bubbly flow, a layered Poiseuille flow, and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. It is shown that the proposed method can track the interface with high accuracy and stability and can significantly and systematically reduce the parasitic current across the interface. Comparisons with momentum-based models indicate that the newly proposed velocity-based model can better satisfy the incompressible condition in the flow fields, and eliminate or reduce the velocity fluctuations in the higher-pressure-gradient region and, therefore, achieve a better numerical stability. In addition, the test of a layered Poiseuille flow demonstrates that the proposed scheme for mixture viscosity performs significantly better than the traditional mixture viscosity methods.},

The presented model recovers the conservative phase-field equation and conserves mass locally and globally. Two entirely different approaches are used to calculate the gradient of the phase field, which is needed in computation of the normal to the interface. One approach uses finite-difference stencils similar to many existing lattice Boltzmann models for tracking the two-phase interface, while the other one invokes central moments to calculate the gradient of the phase field without any finite differences involved. The former approach suffers from the nonlocality of the collision operator while the latter is entirely local making it highly suitable for massive parallel implementation. Several benchmark problems are carried out to assess the accuracy and stability of the proposed model.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Physical Society. Based on phase-field theory, we introduce a robust lattice-Boltzmann equation for modeling immiscible multiphase flows at large density and viscosity contrasts. Our approach is built by modifying the method proposed by Zu and He [Phys. Rev. E 87, 043301 (2013)PLEEE81539-375510.1103/PhysRevE.87.043301] in such a way as to improve efficiency and numerical stability. In particular, we employ a different interface-tracking equation based on the so-called conservative phase-field model, a simplified equilibrium distribution that decouples pressure and velocity calculations, and a local scheme based on the hydrodynamic distribution functions for calculation of the stress tensor. In addition to two distribution functions for interface tracking and recovery of hydrodynamic properties, the only nonlocal variable in the proposed model is the phase field. Moreover, within our framework there is no need to use biased or mixed difference stencils for numerical stability and accuracy at high density ratios. This n ot only simplifies the implementation and efficiency of the model, but also leads to a model that is better suited to parallel implementation on distributed-memory machines. Several benchmark cases are considered to assess the efficacy of the proposed model, including the layered Poiseuille flow in a rectangular channel, Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and the rise of a Taylor bubble in a duct. The numerical results are in good agreement with available numerical and experimental data.},

E 91, 063309 (2015)10.1103/PhysRevE.91.063309] under the framework of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), with incorporation of the incompressible hydrodynamic equations [Liang, Phys. Rev. E 89, 053320 (2014)10.1103/PhysRevE.89.053320] . Utilizing a modified equilibrium distribution function and an additional source term, this model is capable of correctly recovering the conservative ACE through the Chapman-Enskog analysis. We also simulate four phase-tracking benchmark cases, including one three-dimensional case; all show good accuracy as well as low numerical dispersion. By coupling the incompressible hydrodynamic equations, we also simulate layered Poiseuille flow and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, illustrating satisfying performance in dealing with complex flow problems, e.g., high viscosity ratio, high density ratio, and high Reynolds number situations. The present work provides a reliable and efficient solution for binary flow modeling.},

Rev. E 91, 023305 (2015)]. Here, a third-order Chapman-Enskog analysis is used to extend this result from the single-relaxation-time collision operator, to a multiple-relaxation-time cascaded collision operator, whose additional relaxation rates allow a significant increase in stability. Numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme enables almost independent control of density ratio, surface tension, interface width, viscosity, and the additional relaxation rates of the cascaded collision operator. This allows simulation of large density ratio flows at simultaneously high Reynolds and Weber numbers, which is demonstrated through binary collisions of water droplets in air (with density ratio up to 1000, Reynolds number 6200 and Weber number 440). This model represents a significant improvement in multiphase flow simulation by the pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann method in which real-world parameters are finally achievable.},

This expression is used to determine the properties of a flat interface between two coexisting phases. In particular, we find that the thickness of the interface increases with increasing temperature and becomes infinite at the critical temperature Tc, and that at a temperature T just below Tc the interfacial free energy $\sigma$ is proportional to (Tc−Tmath. The predicted interfacial free energy and its temperature dependence are found to be in agreement with existing experimental data. The possibility of using optical measurements of the interface thickness to provide an additional check of our treatment is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a simple and accurate lattice Boltzmann (LB) model for immiscible two-phase flows, which is able to deal with large density contrasts. This model utilizes two LB equations, one of which is used to solve the conservative Allen-Cahn equation, and the other is adopted to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. A novel forcing distribution function is elaborately designed in the LB equation for the Navier-Stokes equations, which make it much simpler than the existing LB models. In addition, the proposed model can achieve superior numerical accuracy compared with previous Allen-Cahn type of LB models. Several benchmark two-phase problems, including static droplet, layered Poiseuille flow, and Spinodal decomposition are simulated to validate the present LB model. It is found that the present model can achieve relatively small spurious velocities in the LB community, and the obtained numerical results also show good agreement with the analytical solutions or some available results. At last, we use the present model to investigate the droplet impact on a thin liquid film with a large density ratio of 1000 and the Reynolds number ranging from 20 to 500. The fascinating phenomenon of droplet splashing is successfully reproduced by the present model and the numerically predicted spreading radius exhibits to obey the power law reported in the literature.},

@article{Li2016b,
abstract = {Over the past few decades, tremendous progress has been made in the development of particle-based discrete simulation methods versus the conventional continuum-based methods. In particular, the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method has evolved from a theoretical novelty to a ubiquitous, versatile and powerful computational methodology for both fundamental research and engineering applications. It is a kinetic-based mesoscopic approach that bridges the microscales and macroscales, which offers distinctive advantages in simulation fidelity and computational efficiency. Applications of the LB method are now found in a wide range of disciplines including physics, chemistry, materials, biomedicine and various branches of engineering. The present work provides a comprehensive review of the LB method for thermofluids and energy applications, focusing on multiphase flows, thermal flows and thermal multiphase flows with phase change. The review first covers the theoretical framework of the LB method, revealing certain inconsistencies and defects as well as common features of multiphase and thermal LB models. Recent developments in improving the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic consistency, reducing spurious currents, enhancing the numerical stability, etc., are highlighted. These efforts have put the LB method on a firmer theoretical foundation with enhanced LB models that can achieve larger liquid-gas density ratio, higher Reynolds number and flexible surface tension. Examples of applications are provided in fuel cells and batteries, droplet collision, boiling heat transfer and evaporation, and energy storage. Finally, further developments and future prospect of the LB method are outlined for thermofluids and energy applications.},

abstract = {The method of lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) is a kinetic-based approach for fluid flow computations. This method has been successfully applied to the multi-phase and multi-component flows. To extend the application of LBE to high Reynolds number incompressible flows, some critical issues need to be addressed, noticeably flexible spatial resolution, boundary treatments for curved solid wall, dispersion and mode of relaxation, and turbulence model. Recent developments in these aspects are highlighted in this paper. These efforts include the study of force evaluation methods, the development of multi-block methods which provide a means to satisfy different resolution requirement in the near wall region and the far field and reduce the memory requirement and computational time, the progress in constructing the second-order boundary condition for curved solid wall, and the analyses of the single-relaxation-time and multiple-relaxation-time models in LBE. These efforts have lead to successful applications of the LBE method to the simulation of incompressible laminar flows and demonstrated the potential of applying the LBE method to higher Reynolds flows. The progress in developing thermal and compressible LBE models and the applications of LBE method in multi-phase flows, multi-component flows, particulate suspensions, turbulent flow, and micro-flows are reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {When the Lattice Boltzmann Method(LBM) is used for simulating continuum fluid flow, the discrete mass distribution must satisfy imposed constraints for density and momentum along the boundaries of the lattice. These constraints uniquely determine the three‐dimensional (3‐D) mass distribution for boundary nodes only when the number of external (inward‐pointing) lattice links does not exceed four. We propose supplementary rules for computing the boundary distribution where the number of external links does exceed four, which is the case for all except simple rectangular lattices. Results obtained with 3‐D body‐centered‐cubic lattices are presented for Poiseuille flow, porous‐plate Couette flow, pipe flow, and rectangular duct flow. The accuracy of the two‐dimensional (2‐D) Poiseuille and Couette flows persists even when the mean free path between collisions is large, but that of the 3‐D duct flow deteriorates markedly when the mean free path exceeds the lattice spacing. Accuracy in general decreases with Knudsen number and Mach number, and the product of these two quantities is a useful index for the applicability of LBM to 3‐D low‐Reynolds‐number flow.},

abstract = {In the continuum limit, the velocity of a Newtonian fluid should vanish at a solid wall. This condition is studied for the FCHC lattice Boltzmann model with rest particles. This goal is achieved by expanding the mean populations up to the second order in terms of the ratio {\$}\backslashvarepsilon{\$} between the lattice unit and a characteristic overall size of the medium. This expansion is applied to two extreme flow situations. In Poiseuille flow, the second eigenvalue of the collision matrix can be chosen so that velocity vanishes at the solid walls with errors smaller than {\$}\backslashvarepsilon{\^{}}2{\$} ; however the choice depends on the angle between the channel walls and the axes of the lattice. In a plane stagnation flow, the tangential and normal velocities do not vanish at the same point, except for particular choices of the parameters of the model ; this point does not coincide with the solid wall. It is concluded that the boundary conditions are as a matter of fact imposed with errors of second order.},

abstract = {We present a general framework for several previously introduced boundary conditions for lattice Boltzmann models, such as the bounce-back rule and the linear and quadratic interpolations. The objectives are twofold: first to give theoretical tools to study the existing link-type boundary conditions and their corresponding accuracy; second to design boundary conditions for general flows which are third-order kinetic accurate. Using these new boundary conditions, Couette and Poiseuille flows are exact solutions of the lattice Boltzmann models for a Reynolds number Re=0 (Stokes limit) for arbitrary inclination with the lattice directions. Numerical comparisons are given for Stokes flows in periodic arrays of spheres and cylinders, linear periodic array of cylinders between moving plates, and for Navier-Stokes flows in periodic arrays of cylinders for Re{\textless}200. These results show a significant improvement of the overall accuracy when using the linear interpolations instead of the bounce-back reflection (up to an order of magnitude on the hydrodynamics fields). Further improvement is achieved with the new multireflection boundary conditions, reaching a level of accuracy close to the quasianalytical reference solutions, even for rather modest grid resolutions and few points in the narrowest channels. More important, the pressure and velocity fields in the vicinity of the obstacles are much smoother with multireflection than with the other boundary conditions. Finally the good stability of these schemes is highlighted by some simulations of moving obstacles: a cylinder between flat walls and a sphere in a cylinder.},

abstract = {We address a "multi-reflection" approach to model Dirichlet and Neumann time-dependent boundary conditions in lattice Boltzmann methods for arbitrarily shaped surfaces. The multi-reflection condition for an incoming population represents a linear combination of the known population solutions. The closure relations are first established for symmetric and anti-symmetric parts of the equilibrium functions, independently of the nature of the problem. The symmetric part is tuned to build second- and third-order accurate Dirichlet boundary conditions for the scalar function specified by the equilibrium distribution. The focus is on two approaches to advection and anisotropic-dispersion equations (AADE): the equilibrium technique when the coefficients of the expanded equilibrium functions match the coefficients of the transformed dispersion tensor, and the eigenvalue technique when the coefficients of the dispersion tensor are built as linear combinations of the eigenvalue functions associated with the link-type collision operator. As a particular local boundary technique, the "anti-bounce-back" condition is analyzed. The anti-symmetric part of the generic closure relation allows to specify normal flux conditions without inversion of the diffusion tensor. Normal and tangential constraints are derived for bounce-back and specular reflections. The bounce-back closure relation is released from the non-physical tangential flux restriction at leading orders. Solutions for the Poisson equation and for convection-diffusion equations are presented for isotropic/anisotropic configurations with specified Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We study the velocity boundary condition for curved boundaries in the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE). We propose a LBE boundary condition for moving boundaries by combination of the "bounce-back" scheme and spatial interpolations of first or second order. The proposed boundary condition is a simple, robust, efficient, and accurate scheme. Second-order accuracy of the boundary condition is demonstrated for two cases: (1) time-dependent two-dimensional circular Couette flow and (2) two-dimensional steady flow past a periodic array of circular cylinders (flow through the porous media of cylinders). For the former case, the lattice Boltzmann solution is compared with the analytic solution of the Navier-Stokes equation. For the latter case, the lattice Boltzmann solution is compared with a finite-element solution of the Navier-Stokes equation. The lattice Boltzmann solutions for both flows agree very well with the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. We also analyze the torque due to the momentum transfer between the fluid and the boundary for two initial conditions: (a) impulsively started cylinder and the fluid at rest, and (b) uniformly rotating fluid and the cylinder at rest.

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a local nonequilibrium scheme for computing the flux of the convection-diffusion equation with a source term in the framework of the multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). Both the Chapman-Enskog analysis and the numerical results show that, at the diffusive scaling, the present nonequilibrium scheme has a second-order convergence rate in space. A comparison between the nonequilibrium scheme and the conventional second-order central-difference scheme indicates that, although both schemes have a second-order convergence rate in space, the present nonequilibrium scheme is more accurate than the central-difference scheme. In addition, the flux computation rendered by the present scheme also preserves the parallel computation feature of the LBM, making the scheme more efficient than conventional finite-difference schemes in the study of large-scale problems. Finally, a comparison between the single-relaxation-time model and the MRT model is also conducted, and the results show that the MRT model is more accurate than the single-relaxation-time model, both in solving the convection-diffusion equation and in computing the flux.},

One scheme is for straight boundaries, with the boundary points locating at any distance from the lattice nodes, and has second-order accuracy. The other is for curved boundaries, has only first-order accuracy and is much simpler than the existing schemes. Unlike those in the literature, our schemes involve only the current lattice node. Such a "single-node" boundary schemes are highly desirable for problems with complex geometries. The two schemes are validated numerically with a number of examples.

abstract = {In this paper a conjugate interface method is developed by performing extrapolations along the normal direction. Compared to other existing conjugate models, our method has several technical advantages, including the simple and straightforward algorithm, accurate representation of the interface geometry, applicability to any interface-lattice relative orientation, and availability of the normal gradient. The model is validated by simulating the steady and unsteady convection-diffusion system with a flat interface and the steady diffusion system with a circular interface, and good agreement is observed when comparing the lattice Boltzmann results with respective analytical solutions. A more general system with unsteady convection-diffusion process and a curved interface, i.e., the cooling process of a hot cylinder in a cold flow, is also simulated as an example to illustrate the practical usefulness of our model, and the effects of the cylinder heat capacity and thermal diffusivity on the cooling process are examined. Results show that the cylinder with a larger heat capacity can release more heat energy into the fluid and the cylinder temperature cools down slower, while the enhanced heat conduction inside the cylinder can facilitate the cooling process of the system. Although these findings appear obvious from physical principles, the confirming results demonstrates the application potential of our method in more complex systems. In addition, the basic idea and algorithm of the counter-extrapolation procedure presented here can be readily extended to other lattice Boltzmann models and even other computational technologies for heat and mass transfer systems.},

Different to the hybrid lattice Boltzmann scheme [O. Filippova, D. Hanel, A novel lattice BGK approach for low Mach number combustion, J. Comput. Phys. 158 (2000) 139], this scheme is strictly pure lattice Boltzmann style (i.e., we solve the flow, temperature, and concentration fields using the lattice Boltzmann method only); different to the non-coupled lattice Boltzmann scheme [K. Yamamoto, X. He, G.D. Doolen, Simulation of combustion field with lattice Boltzmann method, J. Stat. Phys. 107 (2002) 367], the fluid density in this model is coupled directly with the temperature. In this model the time step and the fluid particle speed can be adjusted dynamically, depending on the "particle characteristic temperature". And the algorithm is still a simple process of hopping from one grid point to the next, the same as the standard lattice Boltzmann method. Therefore the outstanding advantages of the standard lattice Boltzmann method are retained in this model besides better numerical stability. Excellent agreement between the present results and other numerical or experimental data shows that this scheme is an efficient numerical method for practical combustion simulations. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

There are two main shortcomings in the existing related works: either some additional energy source terms are inconvenient to be naturally incorporated or the implementation of non-Dirichlet-type thermal boundary conditions is extremely difficult and sometimes impossible in them for complicated thermal systems, which restrict their applicability to only a few special classes of problems. In order to overcome these drawbacks by a simple way, in this paper a thermal LB model and corresponding boundary treatments are constructed based on the total enthalpy. The specific benefits due to the introduction of the total enthalpy are analyzed and it is found that the numerical results obtained by the present scheme agree well with the analytical solutions and/or the data reported in previous studies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract = {So far the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method has matured as a powerful tool to address a diversity of heat and mass transfer challenges. For most practical applications, the variation of thermophysical properties of working media will influence the performance of industrial systems substantially. However, nowadays the efforts to improve the LB method to consider variable thermophysical properties of working media are quite sparse. In the present work we firstly analyze the shortcomings of the available LB approaches for modeling working fluid with variable thermophysical properties. Based on the analysis, a simple LB model is proposed to overcome these shortcomings. The feasibility and reliability of the new LB model have been validated by three simple but nontrivial benchmark tests. Although it is originally proposed to simulate fluid flow with variable thermophysical properties, the present model can be extended directly to some other research areas where variation of thermophysical properties of working media should be considered, such as conjugate heat transfer between solid materials.},

abstract = {We propose a thermal boundary condition treatment based on the " bounce-back" idea and interpolation of the distribution functions for both the Dirichlet and Neumann (normal derivative) conditions in the thermal lattice Boltzmann equation (TLBE) method. The coefficients for the distribution functions involved are determined to satisfy the Dirichlet or Neumann condition with second-order accuracy. For the Dirichlet condition there is an adjustable parameter in the treatment and three particular schemes are selected for demonstration, while for the Neumann condition the second-order accurate scheme is unique. When applied to inclined or curved boundaries, the Dirichlet condition treatment can be directly used, while the Neumann condition given in the normal direction of the boundary should be converted into derivative conditions in the discrete velocity directions of the TLBE model. A spatially coupled formula relating the boundary temperature, boundary normal heat flux, and the distribution functions near the boundary is thus derived for the Neumann problems on curved boundaries. The applicability and accuracy of the present boundary treatments are examined with several numerical tests for which analytical solutions are available, including the 2-dimensional (2-D) steady-state channel flow, the 1-D transient heat conduction in an inclined semi-infinite solid, the 2-D steady-state and transient heat conduction inside a circle and the 3-D steady-state circular pipe flow. While the Dirichlet condition treatment leads to second-order accuracy for the temperature field, it only gives a first-order accurate boundary heat flux because of the irregularity of the cuts by the curved boundary with the lattices. With the Neumann condition on the curved boundary, the accuracy for the temperature field obtained is first-order. When the tangential temperature gradient on the boundary is decoupled, second-order convergence of the temperature field can be obtained with Neumann conditions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

These conditions are constructed in consistency of the wall boundary condition based on an idea of bounceback of non-equilibrium distribution. When these conditions are used together with the improved incompressible LBGK model by Zou et al., the simulation results recover the analytical solution of the plane Poiseuille flow driven by pressure (density) difference with machine accuracy. Since the half-way wall bounceback boundary condition is very easy to implement and was shown theoretically to give second-order accuracy for the 2-D Poiseuille flow with forcing, it is used with pressure (density) inlet/outlet conditions proposed in this paper and in Chen et al. to study the 2-D Poiseuille flow and the 3-D square duct flow. The numerical results are approximately second-order accurate. The magnitude of the error of the half-way wall bounceback is comparable with that using some other published boundary conditions. Besides, the bounceback condition has a much better stability behavior than that of other boundary conditions.},

Finally, we also perform a comparative study on the accuracy and stability of the MRT model and BGK model by using two examples. In terms of the accuracy, both the analysis and numerical results show that a numerical slip on the boundary would be caused in the BGK model, and cannot be eliminated unless the relaxation parameter is fixed to be a special value, while the numerical slip in the MRT model can be overcome once the relaxation parameters satisfy some constrains.

abstract = {To improve the stability of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) at high Reynolds number the cascaded LBM has recently been introduced. As in the multiple relaxation time (MRT) method the cascaded LBM introduces additional relaxation times into the collision operator, but does so in a co-moving reference frame. This has been shown to significantly increase stability at low viscosity in the single phase case. Here the cascaded LBM is further developed to include multiphase flow. For this the force term is calculated by the interaction potential method, and introduced into the collision operator via the exact difference method (EDM). Comparisons are made with the lattice Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (LBGK) method, and an MRT implementation. Both the cascaded and MRT methods are shown to significantly reduce spurious velocities over the LBGK method. For the particular case of the Shan-Chen interparticle force term calculation with the EDM, the cascaded LBM is successfully combined with a multiphase method, and shown to perform as well as the more established MRT method. The cascaded LBM is found to be a considerably improved approach to the simulation of multiphase flow over the LBGK, significantly increasing the stability range of both density ratio and Reynolds number. Additionally the importance of including third order velocity terms in the equilibria of both the cascaded and MRT methods is discussed. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The results of the analysis are verified by several numerical examples. It is also shown numerically that the error of the MRT model is less sensitive to the variation of the relaxation-time coefficients than that of the classical BGK model.

abstract = {A three-dimensional (3D) lattice Boltzmann method based on central moments is derived. Two main elements are the local attractors in the collision term and the source terms representing the effect of external and/or self-consistent internal forces. For suitable choices of the orthogonal moment basis for the three-dimensional, twenty seven velocity (D3Q27), and, its subset, fifteen velocity (D3Q15) lattice models, attractors are expressed in terms of factorization of lower order moments as suggested in an earlier work; the corresponding source terms are specified to correctly influence lower order hydrodynamic fields, while avoiding aliasing effects for higher order moments. These are achieved by successively matching the corresponding continuous and discrete central moments at various orders, with the final expressions written in terms of raw moments via a transformation based on the binomial theorem. Furthermore, to alleviate the discrete effects with the source terms, they are treated to be temporally semi-implicit and second-order, with the implicitness subsequently removed by means of a transformation. As a result, the approach is frame-invariant by construction and its emergent dynamics describing fully 3D fluid motion in the presence of force fields is Galilean invariant. Numerical experiments for a set of benchmark problems demonstrate its accuracy.},

abstract = {Modelling the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic interactions of suspended particles is a significant and ongoing numerical challenge. Addressing this is necessary in order to be able to fully model numerous industrial and scientific processes of practical interest. This paper describes extensions to a local and a non-local technique for the calculation of transient conjugate heat transfer within a lattice Boltzmann framework. The interface transition between phases in both methods has been incorporated via a partially saturated boundary condition that weights material properties and allows straight and curved boundaries to be captured. Transient and steady-state performance of the two methods has been compared using a number of static and dynamic problems to evaluate their suitability for modelling particle suspensions. In a number of the static tests the non-local method produced better results however for the dynamic cases the local method demonstrated more accurate behaviour.},

@article{Karani2015,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose an approach for studying conjugate heat transfer using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The approach is based on reformulating the lattice Boltzmann equation for solving the conservative form of the energy equation. This leads to the appearance of a source term, which introduces the jump conditions at the interface between two phases or components with different thermal properties. The proposed source term formulation conserves conductive and advective heat flux simultaneously, which makes it suitable for modeling conjugate heat transfer in general multiphase or multicomponent systems. The simple implementation of the source term approach avoids any correction of distribution functions neighboring the interface and provides an algorithm that is independent from the topology of the interface. Moreover, our approach is independent of the choice of lattice discretization and can be easily applied to different advection-diffusion LBM solvers. The model is tested against several benchmark problems including steady-state convection-diffusion within two fluid layers with parallel and normal interfaces with respect to the flow direction, unsteady conduction in a three-layer stratified domain, and steady conduction in a two-layer annulus. The LBM results are in excellent agreement with analytical solution. Error analysis shows that our model is first-order accurate in space, but an extension to a second-order scheme is straightforward. We apply our LBM model to heat transfer in a two-component heterogeneous medium with a random microstructure. This example highlights that the method we propose is independent of the topology of interfaces between the different phases and, as such, is ideally suited for complex natural heterogeneous media. We further validate the present LBM formulation with a study of natural convection in a porous enclosure. The results confirm the reliability of the model in simulating complex coupled fluid and thermal dynamics in complex geometries.},

The original LBM was extended in many ways, in the direction of multiphase flows, thermal flows, suspension flows, and to include turbulence, chemical reactions and solute transport. The basic theory of LBM for single-phase flow is well established, although even today research papers are being published that address subtle issues in the theory. Moreover, understanding of the embedding of the LBM in the broader context of the continuous Boltzmann equation, the macroscopic Navier Stokes equations, and microscopic theories is by now well understood. In this document the Lattice Boltzmann Method will first be introduced, followed by a theoretical demonstration that the model indeed mimics incompressible hydrodynamics. Next, the embedding of the method in both microscopic – and macroscopic theories will be clarified.},

abstract = {Fluid motion driven by thermal effects, such as that due to buoyancy in differentially heated three-dimensional (3D) enclosures, arise in several natural settings and engineering applications. It is represented by the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in conjunction with the thermal energy transport equation represented as a convection-diffusion equation (CDE) for the temperature field. In this study, we develop new 3D lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods based on central moments and using multiple relaxation times for the three-dimensional, fifteen velocity (D3Q15) lattice, as well as it subset, i.e. the three-dimensional, seven velocity (D3Q7) lattice to solve the 3D CDE for the temperature field in a double distribution function framework. Their collision operators lead to a cascaded structure involving higher order terms resulting in improved stability. In this approach, the fluid motion is solved by another 3D cascaded LB model from prior work. Owing to the differences in the number of collision invariants to represent the dynamics of flow and the transport of the temperature field, the structure of the collision operator for the 3D cascaded LB formulation for the CDE is found to be markedly different from that for the NSE. The new 3D cascaded (LB) models for thermal convective flows are validated for natural convection of air driven thermally on two vertically opposite faces in a cubic cavity enclosure at different Rayleigh numbers against prior numerical benchmark solutions. Results show good quantitative agreement of the profiles of the flow and thermal fields, and the magnitudes of the peak convection velocities as well as the heat transfer rates given in terms of the Nusselt number},

abstract = {In this paper, a coupling lattice Boltzmann (LB) model for simulating thermal flows on the standard two-dimensional nine-velocity (D2Q9) lattice is developed in the framework of the double-distribution-function (DDF) approach in which the viscous heat dissipation and compression work are considered. In the model, a density distribution function is used to simulate the flow field, while a total energy distribution function is employed to simulate the temperature field. The discrete equilibrium density and total energy distribution functions are obtained from the Hermite expansions of the corresponding continuous equilibrium distribution functions. The pressure given by the equation of state of perfect gases is recovered in the macroscopic momentum and energy equations. The coupling between the momentum and energy transports makes the model applicable for general thermal flows such as non-Boussinesq flows, while the existing DDF LB models on standard lattices are usually limited to Boussinesq flows in which the temperature variation is small. Meanwhile, the simple structure and general features of the DDF LB approach are retained. The model is tested by numerical simulations of thermal Couette flow, attenuation-driven acoustic streaming, and natural convection in a square cavity with small and large temperature differences. The numerical results are found to be in good agreement with the analytical solutions and/or other numerical results reported in the literature},

It achieves this and distinguishes from other collision operators, such as in the standard single or multiple relaxation time approaches, by performing relaxation process due to collisions in terms of moments shifted by the local hydrodynamic fluid velocity, i.e. central moments, in an ascending order-by-order at different relaxation rates. In this paper, we propose and derive source terms in the Cascaded-LBM to represent the effect of external or internal forces on the dynamics of fluid motion. This is essentially achieved by matching the continuous form of the central moments of the source or forcing terms with its discrete version. Different forms of continuous central moments of sources, including one that is obtained from a local Maxwellian, are considered in this regard. As a result, the forcing terms obtained in this new formulation are Galilean invariant by construction. The method of central moments along with the associated orthogonal properties of the moment basis completely determines the expressions for the source terms as a function of the force and macroscopic velocity fields. In contrast to the existing forcing schemes, it is found that they involve higher order terms in velocity space. It is shown that the proposed approach implies "generalization" of both local equilibrium and source terms in the usual lattice frame of reference, which depend on the ratio of the relaxation times of moments of different orders. An analysis by means of the Chapman-Enskog multiscale expansion shows that the Cascaded-LBM with forcing terms is consistent with the Navier-Stokes equations. Computational experiments with canonical problems involving different types of forces demonstrate its accuracy.},

Subsequently, the cascaded collision model is applied to the lid-driven porous-filled cavity to demonstrate the largely augmented numerical stability of the model against the more common Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook and multiple relaxation time collision models. Finally, the cascaded model is applied to an inflow–outflow case of flow and heat transfer over a porous bluff body to showcase its efficiency in capturing the complex fluid and heat transport phenomenon through porous media.},

abstract = {In this paper, a thermal cascaded lattice Boltzmann method (TCLBM) is developed in combination with the double-distribution-function (DDF) approach on the standard D2Q9 lattice. A density distribution function relaxed by the cascaded scheme based on central moments is employed to solve the flow field, and a total energy distribution function relaxed by the BGK scheme is used to solve the temperature field. The two distribution functions are coupled naturally to provide a new TCLBM. In this method, the viscous heat dissipation and compression work are taken into account, the Prandtl number and specific-heat ratio are adjustable, and the external force is considered directly without the Boussinesq assumption. The TCLBM is validated by numerical experiments of the thermal Couette flow, low-Mach number shock tube problem, Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection, and natural convection in a square cavity with a large temperature difference. The simulation results agree well with the analytical solutions and/or results given by previous researchers.},

In the method, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the convection-diffusion equation for the temperature field are solved separately by two different CLB equations. Through the Chapman-Enskog analysis, the macroscopic governing equations for incompressible thermal flows can be reproduced. The consistent forcing scheme (Fei and Luo, 2017) is adopted to incorporate forcing effect, and the implementation for CLBM is simplified by using simplified raw-moment sets. Compared with several D2Q5 multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann methods for the temperature equation, the proposed method is shown to be better Galilean invariant through measuring the thermal diffusivities on a moving reference frame. Numerical simulations for several typical problems confirm the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of the present method. The grid convergence tests indicate that the proposed CLBM for incompressible thermal flows is of second-order accuracy in space.},

E $\backslash$textbf{\{}63{\}}, 066705 (2006)] possesses very good numerical stability. However, two constraints exist in three-dimensional (3D) CLBM simulations. Firstly, the conventional implementation for 3D CLBM involves cumbersome operations and requires much higher computational cost compared to the single-relaxation-time (SRT) LBM. Secondly, it is a challenge to accurately incorporate a general force field into the 3D CLBM. In this paper, we present an improved method to implement CLBM in 3D. The main strategy is to adopt a simplified central moment set, and carry out the central-moment-based collision operator based on a general multi-relaxation-time (GMRT) framework. Next, the recently proposed consistent forcing scheme in CLBM [L. Fei and K. H. Luo, Phys. Rev. E $\backslash$textbf{\{}96{\}}, 053307 (2017)] is extended to incorporate a general force field into 3D CLBM. Compared with the recently developed non-orthogonal CLBM [A. D. Rosis, Phys. Rev. E $\backslash$textbf{\{}95{\}}, 013310 (2017)], our implementation is proved to reduce the computational cost significantly. The inconsistency of adopting the discrete equilibrium distribution functions (EDFs) in the non-orthogonal CLBM is revealed and discussed. The 3D CLBM developed here in conjunction with the consistent forcing scheme is verified through numerical simulations of several canonical force-driven flows, highlighting very good properties in terms of accuracy, convergence and consistency with the nonslip rule. Finally, the techniques developed here for 3D CLBM can be applied to make the implementation and execution of 3D MRT-LBM much more efficient.},
